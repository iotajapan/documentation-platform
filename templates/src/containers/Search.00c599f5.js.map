Adding\n * wildcards will increase the number of documents that will be found but can also have a negative\n * impact on query performance, especially with wildcards at the beginning of a term.\n *\n * Terms can be restricted to specific fields, e.g. `title:hello`, only documents with the term\n * hello in the title field will match this query. Using a field not present in the index will lead\n * to an error being thrown.\n *\n * Modifiers can also be added to terms, lunr supports edit distance and boost modifiers on terms. A term\n * boost will make documents matching that term score higher, e.g. `foo^5`. Edit distance is also supported\n * to provide fuzzy matching, e.g. 'hello~2' will match documents with hello with an edit distance of 2.\n * Avoid large values for edit distance to improve query performance.\n *\n * Each term also supports a presence modifier. By default a term's presence in document is optional, however\n * this can be changed to either required or prohibited. For a term's presence to be required in a document the\n * term should be prefixed with a '+', e.g. `+foo bar` is a search for documents that must contain 'foo' and\n * optionally contain 'bar'. Conversely a leading '-' sets the terms presence to prohibited, i.e. it must not\n * appear in a document, e.g. `-foo bar` is a search for documents that do not contain 'foo' but may contain 'bar'.\n *\n * To escape special characters the backslash character '\\' can be used, this allows searches to include\n * characters that would normally be considered modifiers, e.g. `foo\\~2` will search for a term \"foo~2\" instead\n * of attempting to apply a boost of 2 to the search term \"foo\".\n *\n * @typedef {string} lunr.Index~QueryString\n * @example <caption>Simple single term query</caption>\n * hello\n * @example <caption>Multiple term query</caption>\n * hello world\n * @example <caption>term scoped to a field</caption>\n * title:hello\n * @example <caption>term with a boost of 10</caption>\n * hello^10\n * @example <caption>term with an edit distance of 2</caption>\n * hello~2\n * @example <caption>terms with presence modifiers</caption>\n * -foo +bar baz\n */\n\n/**\n * Performs a search against the index using lunr query syntax.\n *\n * Results will be returned sorted by their score, the most relevant results\n * will be returned first.

Adding\n * wildcards will increase the number of documents that will be found but can also have a negative\n * impact on query performance, especially with wildcards at the beginning of a term.\n *\n * Terms can be restricted to specific fields, e.g. `title:hello`, only documents with the term\n * hello in the title field will match this query. Using a field not present in the index will lead\n * to an error being thrown.\n *\n * Modifiers can also be added to terms, lunr supports edit distance and boost modifiers on terms. A term\n * boost will make documents matching that term score higher, e.g. `foo^5`. Edit distance is also supported\n * to provide fuzzy matching, e.g. 'hello~2' will match documents with hello with an edit distance of 2.\n * Avoid large values for edit distance to improve query performance.\n *\n * Each term also supports a presence modifier. By default a term's presence in document is optional, however\n * this can be changed to either required or prohibited. For a term's presence to be required in a document the\n * term should be prefixed with a '+', e.g. `+foo bar` is a search for documents that must contain 'foo' and\n * optionally contain 'bar'. Conversely a leading '-' sets the terms presence to prohibited, i.e. it must not\n * appear in a document, e.g. `-foo bar` is a search for documents that do not contain 'foo' but may contain 'bar'.\n *\n * To escape special characters the backslash character '\\' can be used, this allows searches to include\n * characters that would normally be considered modifiers, e.g. `foo\\~2` will search for a term \"foo~2\" instead\n * of attempting to apply a boost of 2 to the search term \"foo\".\n *\n * @typedef {string} lunr.Index~QueryString\n * @example <caption>Simple single term query</caption>\n * hello\n * @example <caption>Multiple term query</caption>\n * hello world\n * @example <caption>term scoped to a field</caption>\n * title:hello\n * @example <caption>term with a boost of 10</caption>\n * hello^10\n * @example <caption>term with an edit distance of 2</caption>\n * hello~2\n * @example <caption>terms with presence modifiers</caption>\n * -foo +bar baz\n */\n\n/**\n * Performs a search against the index using lunr query syntax.\n *\n * Results will be returned sorted by their score, the most relevant results\n * will be returned first.
