Hub offers you a secure way to manage deposits and withdrawals of users' IOTA tokens. When a user deposits IOTA tokens into one of their Hub addresses, Hub transfers those tokens to the Hub owners address in a process called a sweep. This way, the Hub owner can make sure that users' tokens are secure until they request a withdrawal.\n-------------------------\n\n","title":"Overview | Introduction | ウォレット"}}
