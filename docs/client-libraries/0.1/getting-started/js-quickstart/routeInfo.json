Set up a developer environment\n\n2. Install packages\n\n3. Connect to a node\n\n## Step 1. Set up a developer environment\n\nTo use the JavaScript client library, you need a set of programming tools, which make up a development environment.\n\n1. Install the [latest long-term support (LTS) version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\n\n2. Install a code editor. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), but many more are available.\n\n3. Open a command-line interface\n\n    Depending on your operating system, a command-line interface could be [PowerShell in Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6), the [Linux Terminal](https://www.howtogeek.com/140679/beginner-geek-how-to-start-using-the-linux-terminal/) or [Terminal for macOS](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac).\n\n4. Create a new directory to use for your project and change into it\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir myNewProject\n    cd myNewProject\n    ```\n\n5. Initialize a new project\n\n    ```bash\n    npm init\n    ```\n\nNow you have a `package.json` file, which includes the packages and applications your project depends on, and specific metadata like the project's name, description, and author. Whenever you install packages, those packages will be added to this file as a dependency. For more information, see this excellent [package.json guide](https://flaviocopes.com/package-json/).\n\n## Step 2. Install packages\n\nThe JavaScript client library is organized in packages, which contain related methods. For example, the `core` package contains methods for requesting information from nodes, creating transactions, and sending them to nodes.\n\nAll the packages are listed on the [iota.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/next/packages).\n\nTo install the library packages, you can use one of the following package managers:\n\n- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included in Node.js downloads)\n- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)\n\nIn a command-line interface, change into the directory where you initialized your project, and install the packages\n\n--------------------\n### npm\nThis command installs the `core` package\n\n```bash\nnpm install @iota/core\n```\n---\n### Yarn\nThis command installs the `core` package\n\n```bash\nyarn add @iota/core\n```\n--------------------\n\nIf everything went well, you should see something like the following in the output. You can ignore any 'npm WARN' messages.\n\n```shell\n+ @iota/core@1.0.0-beta.8\nadded 19 packages from 10 contributors and audited 68 packages in 5.307s\nfound 0 vulnerabilities\n```\n\nAfter installing a package, you'll have a `node_modules` directory, which contains the `core` package code and its dependencies.\n\nNow you can start coding.\n\n## Step 3. Connect to a node\n\nIt's best practice to make sure that you're connected to a [synchronized node](/docs/getting-started/0.1/network/nodes#synchronized-nodes) before you start sending transactions to it. This way, you know that it has an up-to-date view of [the Tangle](/docs/getting-started/0.1/network/the-tangle).\n\nWhenever you connect to a node, you need to know which [IOTA network](/docs/getting-started/0.1/network/iota-networks) it's in. Here, we connect to a node on the Devnet, which is the IOTA networks that you can use for testing.\n\n1. Go to the IOTA Foundation [Discord](https://discord.iota.org) and enter **!milestone** in the `botbox` channel\n\n    ![Entering !milestone on Discord](/assets/docs/client-libraries/0.1/images/discord-milestone-check.PNG)\n\n    The Discord bot should return the current `latestMilestoneIndex` field from a [node quorum](/docs/getting-started/0.1/network/nodes#node-quorum).\n\n2. In the directory where you initialized your project, create a new file called `index.js`\n\n3. To check if your node is synchronized, copy and paste the following code into the `index.js` file\n\n    ```js\n    // Require the IOTA library\n    const Iota = require('@iota/core');\n\n    // Create a new instance of the IOTA API object\n    // Use the `provider` field to specify which node to connect to\n    const iota = Iota.composeAPI({\n    provider: 'https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443'\n    });\n\n    // Call the `getNodeInfo()` method for information about the node and the Tangle\n    iota.getNodeInfo()\n    // Convert the returned object to JSON to make the output more readable\n    .then(info => console.log(JSON.stringify(info, null, 1)))\n    .catch(err => {\n        // Catch any errors\n        console.log(err);\n    });\n    ```\n\n4. Execute the file\n\n    ```bash\n    node index.js\n    ```\n\nThe node returns the following:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"appName\": \"IRI Testnet\",\n    \"appVersion\": \"1.5.6-RELEASE\",\n    \"jreAvailableProcessors\": 8,\n    \"jreFreeMemory\": 12052395632,\n    \"jreVersion\": \"1.8.0_181\",\n    \"jreMaxMemory\": 22906667008,\n    \"jreTotalMemory\": 16952328192,\n    \"latestMilestone\": \"FPRSBTMKOP9JTTQSHWRGMPT9PBKYWFCCFLZLNWQDFRCXDDHZEFIEDXRIJYIMVGCXYQRHSZQYCTWXJM999\",\n    \"latestMilestoneIndex\": 1102841,\n    \"latestSolidSubtangleMilestone\": \"FPRSBTMKOP9JTTQSHWRGMPT9PBKYWFCCFLZLNWQDFRCXDDHZEFIEDXRIJYIMVGCXYQRHSZQYCTWXJM999\",\n    \"latestSolidSubtangleMilestoneIndex\": 1102841,\n    \"milestoneStartIndex\": 434525,\n    \"neighbors\": 3,\n    \"packetsQueueSize\": 0,\n    \"time\": 1549482118137,\n    \"tips\": 153,\n    \"transactionsToRequest\": 0,\n    \"features\": [\"snapshotPruning\", \"dnsRefresher\", \"testnet\", \"zeroMessageQueue\", \"tipSolidification\", \"RemotePOW\"],\n    \"coordinatorAddress\": \"EQQFCZBIHRHWPXKMTOLMYUYPCN9XLMJPYZVFJSAY9FQHCCLWTOLLUGKKMXYFDBOOYFBLBI9WUEILGECYM\",\n    \"duration\": 0\n}\n```\n\n### Reading the response object\n\nIf the `latestMilestoneIndex` field is equal to the one you got from Discord and the `latestSolidSubtangleMilestoneIndex` field, the node is synchronized.\n\nIf not, try connecting to a different node. The [iota.dance website](https://iota.dance/) includes a list of Mainnet nodes. Or, you can [run your own node](/docs/node-software/0.1/iri/how-to-guides/quickstart).\n\nIn the `features` array, you can see that this node also support [remote proof of work](/docs/getting-started/0.1/transactions/proof-of-work) (RemotePOW). As a result, you can use this node to do proof of work instead of doing it on your local device.\n\nAlso, this node has its zero message queue (ZMQ) enabled, so you can use it to [listen for live transactions](../how-to-guides/js/listen-for-transactions.md).\n\nFor more information about these fields, see the [IRI API reference](/docs/node-software/0.1/iri/references/api-reference#getNodeInfo).\n\n:::success: Congratulations :tada:\nYou've confirmed your connection to a synchronized node.\n:::\n\n## Run the code\n\nWe use the [REPL.it tool](https://repl.it) to allow you to run sample code in the browser.\n\nClick the green button to run the code and see the results in the window.\n\n<iframe height=\"600px\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://repl.it/@jake91/Connect-to-a-node?lite=true\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n## Support the project\n\nIf the IOTA JavaScript client library has been useful to you and you feel like contributing, consider posting a [bug report](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/issues/new), [feature request](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/issues/new), or a [pull request](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/pulls/).  \n\n### Running tests\n\nMake your changes on a single package or across multiple packages and test the them by running the following command from the root directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\nTo run tests for a specific package, change into the package's directory and run the `npm run test` command.\n\n### Updating the documentation\n\nIf your changes affect the documentation, please update it by editing the [`JSDoc`](http://usejsdoc.org) annotations and running `npm run docs` from the root directory.\n\n## Get involved\n\n[Join our Discord channel](https://discord.iota.org) where you can:\n\n- Take part in discussions with IOTA developers and the community\n- Ask for help\n- Share your knowledge to help others\n\nWe have many channels, including the following:\n\n- `-dev`: These channels are read-only and are where developers discuss topics with each other and where you can see any code updates from GitHub.\n\n- `-discussion`: These channels are where you can participate.\n\n## Next steps\n\nContinue learning with our [JavaScript workshop](../how-to-guides/js/get-started.md).\n\nRead our [developer's handbook](/docs/getting-started/0.1/references/quickstart-dev-handbook) for guidance on whether you should run your own node, whether you need a private IOTA network, and what you need to consider for both.","title":"JavaScriptクイックスタート | 入門 | CLライブラリ"}}
