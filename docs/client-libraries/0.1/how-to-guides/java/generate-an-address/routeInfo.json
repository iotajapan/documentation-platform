Import the classes\n\n    ```java\n    package com.iota;\n\n    import org.iota.jota.IotaAPI;\n    import org.iota.jota.builder.AddressRequest;\n    import org.iota.jota.dto.response.GetNewAddressResponse;\n    import org.iota.jota.error.ArgumentException;\n    ```\n2. Connect to a node\n\n    ```java\n    IotaAPI api = new IotaAPI.Builder()\n            .protocol(\"https\")\n            .host(\"nodes.devnet.thetangle.org\")\n            .port(443)\n            .build();\n    ```\n\n3. Define the security level that you want to use for your address\n\n    ```java\n    int securityLevel = 2;\n    ```\n\n4. Define a seed for which to generate an address\n\n    ```java\n    String mySeed = \"PUPTTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX\";\n    ```\n\n5. Use the [`generateNewAddresses()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-java/blob/dev/docs/iota-java/generateNewAddresses.md) method to generate an unspent address\n\n    ```java\n    try { \n        GetNewAddressResponse response = api.generateNewAddresses(new AddressRequest.Builder(mySeed, securityLevel).amount(1).checksum(true).build());\n        System.out.printf(\"Your address is %s\", response.getAddresses());\n    } catch (ArgumentException e) { \n        // Handle error\n        e.printStackTrace(); \n    }\n    ```\n\nStarting from the given index, the connected node checks the following:\n\n- If any input transactions (pending or confirmed) in its view of the Tangle withdraw from the address\n- If the address is in the node's list of spent addresses (addresses that were withdrawn from in confirmed transactions)\n\nIf an address with the given index is spent, the index is incremented until the node finds one that isn't spent.\n\n:::warning:\nThis way of generating addresses replies on the node to return valid data about your addresses. To have more control over your addresses, we recommend using the [account module](../../account-module/introduction/overview.md) to keep track of spent addresses in your own local database.\n:::\n\nIn the console, you should see an address.\n\n```\nYour address is: WKJDF9LVQCVKEIVHFAOMHISHXJSGXWBJFYEQPOQKSVGZZFLTUUPBACNQZTAKXR9TFVKBGYSNSPHRNKKHA\n```\n\n:::success:Congratulations :tada:\nYou've just generated a new unspent address. You can share this address with anyone who wants to send you a transaction.\n:::\n\n## Run the code\n\nTo get started you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your device.\n\nYou also need a Java development environment that uses the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) build tool. If this is your first time using the Java client library, complete our [getting started guide](../../getting-started/java-quickstart.md), and follow the instructions for installing the library with Maven.\n\nIn the command-line, do the following:\n\n--------------------\n### Linux and macOS\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/JakeSCahill/java-iota-workshop.git\ncd java-iota-workshop\nmvn clean install\nmvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.iota.GenerateAddress\"\n```\n---\n### Windows\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/JakeSCahill/java-iota-workshop.git\ncd java-iota-workshop\nmvn clean install\nmvn exec:java -D\"exec.mainClass\"=\"com.iota.GenerateAddress\"\n```\n--------------------\n\nIn the console, you should see an address.\n\n```\nYour address is: WKJDF9LVQCVKEIVHFAOMHISHXJSGXWBJFYEQPOQKSVGZZFLTUUPBACNQZTAKXR9TFVKBGYSNSPHRNKKHA\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\n[Send test IOTA tokens to your new address](../java/transfer-iota-tokens.md).\n","title":"新しいアドレスを生成する | Java | ハウツーガイド | CLライブラリ"}}
