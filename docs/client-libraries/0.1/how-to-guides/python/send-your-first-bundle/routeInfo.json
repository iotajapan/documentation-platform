These transactions are useful for storing messages on the [Tangle](/docs/getting-started/0.1/network/the-tangle) without having to send any [IOTA tokens](/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token).**\n\n## Packages\n\nTo complete this guide, you need to install the following package:\n\n```bash\npip install pyota\n```\n\n## IOTA network\n\nIn this guide, we connect to a [node](/docs/getting-started/0.1/network/nodes) on the [Devnet](/docs/getting-started/0.1/network/iota-networks#devnet) with the following network settings:\n\n- **[Minimum weight magnitude](/docs/getting-started/0.1/network/minimum-weight-magnitude)**: 9\n\n- **[Depth](/docs/getting-started/0.1/transactions/depth)**: 3\n\n1. Import the packages\n\n    ```python\n    from iota import Iota\n    from iota import ProposedTransaction\n    from iota import Address\n    from iota import Tag\n    from iota import TryteString\n    ```\n\n2. Connect to a node\n\n    ```python\n    api = Iota('https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443', testnet = True)\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    The `testnet` argument sets the [minimum weight magnitude](/docs/getting-started/0.1/network/minimum-weight-magnitude) to 9.\n    :::\n\n3. Define an [address](/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/addresses) to which you want to send a message\n\n    ```python\n    address = 'ZLGVEQ9JUZZWCZXLWVNTHBDX9G9KZTJP9VEERIIFHY9SIQKYBVAHIMLHXPQVE9IXFDDXNHQINXJDRPFDXNYVAPLZAW'\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    This address does not have to belong to anyone. To be valid, the address just needs to consist of 81 [trytes](/docs/getting-started/0.1/introduction/ternary).\n    :::\n\n4. Define a message that you want to send to the address and convert it to trytes\n\n    ```python\n    message = TryteString.from_unicode('Hello world')\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    Although the `from_unicode()` method supports UTF-8 characters, we recommended using only [basic ASCII characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters) until it has been standardized across the other official libraries.\n    :::\n\n5. Define a zero-value transaction that sends the message to the address\n\n    ```python\n    tx = ProposedTransaction(\n    address = Address(address),\n    message = message,\n    value = 0\n    )\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    The Python library makes a disctinction between proposed and regular transaction objects. Proposed transaction objects are those that you can edit because they are not yet attached to the Tangle. In contrast, regular transaction objects are immutable because they are already attached to the Tangle.\n    :::\n\n6. Pass your `ProposedTransaction` object to the [`send_transfer()`](https://pyota.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#send-transfer) method to do [tip selection](/docs/node-software/0.1/iri/concepts/tip-selection), [remote proof of work](/docs/getting-started/0.1/transactions/proof-of-work), and to send the bundle to the node\n\n    ```python\n    result = api.send_transfer(transfers = [tx])\n\n    print('Bundle: ')\n    print(result['bundle'].hash)\n    ```\n\n    In the console, you should see the bundle hash of the transaction you just sent.\n\n:::success:Congratulations :tada:\nYou've just sent your first zero-value transaction. Your transaction is attached to the Tangle, and will be forwarded to the rest of the network. This transaction is now immutable, and as long as you have its bundle hash, you can read it on the Tangle.\n:::\n\n## Run the code\n\nWe use the [REPL.it tool](https://repl.it) to allow you to run sample code in the browser.\n\nClick the green button to run the sample code in this guide and see the results in the window.\n\n<iframe height=\"600px\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://repl.it/@jake91/Send-a-hello-world-transaction-Python?lite=true\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n## Next steps\n\nMake a note of the bundle hash so you can [read the transaction data on the Tangle](../python/read-transactions.md).\n\nYou can also read your transaction, using a utility such as the [Tangle explorer](https://utils.iota.org).\n","title":"\"hello world\" トランザクションを送信する | Python | ハウツーガイド | CLライブラリ"}}
