To request the balance from a node, you must send it the address whose balance you want to check. In this guide, you check the total balance of addresses that belong to a seed.**\n\n## Packages\n\nTo complete this guide, you need to install the following package:\n\n```bash\npip install pyota\n```\n\n## IOTA network\n\nIn this guide, we connect to a node on the [Devnet](/docs/getting-started/0.1/network/iota-networks#devnet).\n\n## Code walkthrough\n\n1. Import the packages\n\n    ```python\n    from iota import Iota\n    ```\n\n2. Define your seed. Replace this seed with one that owns an address with test IOTA tokens\n\n    ```python\n    seed = 'JBN9ZRCOH9YRUGSWIQNZWAIFEZUBDUGTFPVRKXWPAUCEQQFS9NHPQLXCKZKRHVCCUZNF9CZZWKXRZVCWQ'\n    ```\n\n3. Connect to a node\n\n    ```python\n    api = Iota('https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443', seed)\n    ```\n\n4. Use the [`get_account_data()`](https://pyota.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#get-account-data) method to ask the node for the current balance of the seed's addresses\n\n    ```python\n    balance = api.get_account_data()\n    print('The balance for your seed is: ', balance['balance'])\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    This method starts from index 0 and asks the node if it has one or more input transactions that withdraw from the address. If the node has input transactions that withdraw from the address, the index is incremented and this process continues until an unspent address is found.\n    :::\n\n    In the console, you should see a balance of IOTA tokens:\n\n    ```\n    The balance for your seed is: 500\n    ```\n\n:::success:Congratulations :tada:\nYou've just checked the seed's balance.\n:::\n\n## Run the code\n\nWe use the [REPL.it tool](https://repl.it) to allow you to run sample code in the browser.\n\nClick the green button to run the sample code in this guide and see the results in the window.\n\n<iframe height=\"600px\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://repl.it/@jake91/Check-the-balance-of-an-address-Python?lite=true\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n## Next steps\n\n[Listen for live transactions on the Tangle](../python/listen-for-transactions.md).\n\nYou can also check the balance of an address, using a utility such as the [Tangle explorer](https://utils.iota.org).\n","title":"アドレスの残高を確認する | Python | ハウツーガイド | CLライブラリ"}}
