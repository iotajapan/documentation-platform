Import the packages\n\n    ```go\n    package main\n\n    import (\n        . \"github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/api\"\n        \"github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/trinary\"\n        \"fmt\"\n    )\n    ```\n2. Connect to a node\n\n    ```go\n    var node = \"https://nodes.devnet.thetangle.org\"\n    api, err := ComposeAPI(HTTPClientSettings{URI: node})\n    must(err)\n    ```\n\n3. Define the security level that you want to use for your address\n\n    ```go\n    const securityLevel = 2;\n    ```\n\n4. Define a seed for which to generate an address\n\n    ```go\n    const seed = trinary.Trytes(\"PUETPSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX\")\n    ```\n\n5. Use the [`GetNewAddress()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/blob/master/.docs/iota.go/reference/api_get_new_address.md) method to generate an unspent address\n\n    ```go\n    addresses, err := api.GetNewAddress(seed, GetNewAddressOptions{Security:securityLevel})\n    must(err)\n\n    fmt.Println(\"\\nYour address is: \", addresses[0])\n    ```\n\nStarting from the given index, the connected node checks the following:\n\n- If any input transactions (pending or confirmed) in its view of the Tangle withdraw from the address\n- If the address is in the node's list of spent addresses (addresses that were withdrawn from in confirmed transactions)\n\nIf an address with the given index is spent, the index is incremented until the node finds one that isn't spent.\n\n:::warning:\nThis way of generating addresses replies on the node to return valid data about your addresses. To have more control over your addresses, we recommend using the [account module](../../account-module/introduction/overview.md) to keep track of spent addresses in your own local database.\n:::\n\nIn the console, you should see an address.\n\n```\nYour address is: WKJDF9LVQCVKEIVHFAOMHISHXJSGXWBJFYEQPOQKSVGZZFLTUUPBACNQZTAKXR9TFVKBGYSNSPHRNKKHA\n```\n\n:::success:Congratulations :tada:\nYou've just generated a new unspent address. You can share this address with anyone who wants to send you a transaction.\n:::\n\n## Run the code\n\nWe use the [REPL.it tool](https://repl.it) to allow you to run sample code in the browser.\n\nClick the green button to run the sample code in this guide and see the results in the window.\n\n<iframe height=\"600px\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://repl.it/@jake91/Generate-an-address-Go?lite=true\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n## Next steps\n\n[Send test IOTA tokens to your new address](../go/transfer-iota-tokens.md).\n","title":"新しいアドレスを生成する | Go | ハウツーガイド | CLライブラリ"}}
