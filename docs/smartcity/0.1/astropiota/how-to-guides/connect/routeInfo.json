To find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi, you can use a Python script.**\n\nPython 3 comes pre-installed on Raspberry Pi.\n\n1. In your home folder, create a new file called `senseIP.py`\n         ```bash\n        sudo nano senseIP.py\n        ```\n\n2. Add the following code to the file:\n\n    ```python\n        import socket\n        from sense_hat import SenseHat\n        sense = SenseHat()\n\n        def getIP():\n                s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\n                try:\n                        s.connect(('192.168.255.255',1))        #lab network used for this example\n                        IP = s.getsockname()[0]\n                except:\n                        IP = '127.0.0.1'\n                finally:\n                        s.close()\n                return IP\n\n        senseIP = getIP()\n        for x in range(3):\n                sense.show_message(senseIP, scroll_speed=0.2)\n    ```\n\n3. Save the file and create a new shell script\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo nano senseBoot.sh\n    ```\n\n4. Run the senseIP.py script\n\n    ```bash\n    python3 senseIP.py\n    ```\n\n    ![Screen capture of shell script described in text](/assets/docs/smartcity/0.1/astropiota/RasSenseIP.png)\n\n5. Save the shell script and schedule a cron job to run it when Raspberry Pi reboots\n\n    ```bash\n    crontab -e\n    ```\n\n6. Add the following command at the bottom of the /tmp/crontab.0QNkTW/crontab file:  \n\n    ```\n    @reboot /home/pi/senseBoot.sh\n    ```\n\n    ![Screen capture of crontab file update described in text](/assets/docs/smartcity/0.1/astropiota/RasCron.png)\n\n7. Restart Raspberry Pi to start the cron job. Wait a second or two, then see its IP address scrolling across the Sense HAT LED panel.\n\n8. Open an SSH connection and connect to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi\n\nTo shut down the Raspberry Pi, do the following:\n\n```bash\nsudo shutdown now\n```\n\n\n","title":"Connect to AstroPiOTA over an SHH connection | Smart City"}}
