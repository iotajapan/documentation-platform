This starter pack includes the SD Memory Card with Raspbian pre-installed plus some additional components for other experiments.\n\n> Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (B plus) has pins that prevent attaching Sense HAT version 1.0. \n\nThere are two ways to interact with Raspberry Pi, directly and over SSH.  In order to interact directly, get a USB keyboard and mouse plus an HDMI-ready monitor or TV.  Interact over SSH using [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)\n\nYou may power Raspberry Pi with a wall plug or a USB battery capable of powering mobile phones.\n\n## Operating System\n\nFor this example, I purchased the pre-installed card that comes with the Starter Pack. If you are starting from scratch, follow the [Raspberry Pi getting started guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started/2).  W3Schools also has a [getting started guide](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_raspberrypi.asp).  Download the Starter Pack version at: [Raspbian GNU/Linux 8 \"Jessie\" (2016-11-25-raspbian-jessie.img)](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/)\n\n## Connect Components\n\n- [Carefully attach SenseHat to Raspberry Pi](https://docs-emea.rs-online.com/webdocs/1436/0900766b81436bef.pdf)\n\n![Screen capture of crontab file update described in text](/assets/docs/smartcity/0.1/astropiota/RasSen2Ras.png)\n\nPermission to use diagram requested from Raspberry Pi\n\n- Connect keyboard and mouse to USB ports on Raspberry Pi\n- Connect monitor or TV to HDMI port on Raspberry Pi\n- Connect power cord on Raspberry Pi\n\n>When you plug in the power cord, Raspberry Pi will power on\n\n[Run AstroPiOTA](../how-to-guides/run.md)\n","title":"Build AstroPiOTA | AstroPiOTA | スマートシティ"}}
