As a result, many calls to this endpoint can sometimes cause the node to crash. In this guide, you install a dedicated proxy server to do proof of work (PoW) to intercept calls this this endpoint and do the proof of work.**\n\n## Download, build, and run the proxy server\n\nThe PoW proxy server is an implementation of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) that uses IOTA middleware. This middleware allows the server to intercept calls to an IRI node's `attachToTangle` endpoint and do the PoW.\n\n:::info:\nAll requests to the other IRI API endpoints are forwarded to the IRI node.\n:::\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this guide, you need the following:\n\n- At least version 1.12 of the Go programming language (we recommend the latest version)\n- GCC: For macOS, you can install GCC using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (`brew install gcc`). For Windows, you can [install TDM-GCC](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download). For Linux (Ubuntu 18.04), you can [install GCC from the `build-essential` package](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-gcc-compiler-on-ubuntu-18-04/).\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n\n---\n\n1. In the command-line interface, check your `GOPATH` environment variable\n\n    ```bash\n    go env GOPATH\n    ````\n\n2. In any directory outside of the one in your `GOPATH` environment variable, clone the `iotacaddy` GitHub repository\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/luca-moser/iotacaddy.git\n    ```\n\n3. Change into the `iotacaddy/caddy` directory\n\n    ```bash\n    cd iotacaddy/caddy\n    ```\n\n4. Build the executable file with either the AVX or SSE implementation\n\n    ```bash\n    # AVX\n    go build -tags=\"pow_avx\"\n    #SSE\n    go build -tags=\"pow_sse\"\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    Most modern CPUs support AVX, but you should check which implementation your one supports.\n    :::\n\n    This action will create a executable file called `caddy` in the `iotacaddy/caddy` directory.\n\n5. Create a file called `Caddyfile` in the same directory as your `caddy` executable file\n\n6. Configure your PoW proxy server by [editing the `Caddyfile` file](https://caddyserver.com/tutorial/caddyfile). In this example, we run the PoW proxy server on localhost. If you want to access your PoW proxy server from an external network, change the URL to your public IP address and make sure that the port is open. \n\n    ```bash\n    # Set the URL of your PoW proxy server\n    127.0.0.1:15265 {\n\n    gzip\n\n    # Log requests to the proxy with rotation\n    log requests.log {\n        rotate_size 100\n        rotate_age  90\n        rotate_keep 20\n        rotate_compress\n        }\n\n    #tls /etc/letsencrypt/live/iota-tangle.io/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/iota-tangle.io/privkey.pem\n\n    # Limit request body to 10 megabytes\n    limits 10mb\n\n    # Intercept calls that have a maximum MWM of 14 and include a maximum of 20 transactions per call\n    iota 14 20\n\n    # Set up a reverse proxy to your IRI node\n    # In this example, we connect to a public Devnet node, but you can also connect to your own node\n    proxy / https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443 {\n        header_upstream X-IOTA-API-VERSION 1.4\n        header_upstream Access-Control-Allow-Origin *\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    If you want to the connection between the client and the PoW proxy server to be secure, remove the hash symbol (#) before the `tls` directive and change the paths to point to your SSL certificates.\n    :::\n\n7. To execute this file on Linux or macOS, do `./caddy`. To execute this file on Windows, double click it, or do `.\\caddy` in the command-line interface.\n\n    When the PoW proxy server starts, you should see something like the following:\n\n    ```bash\n    Activating privacy features... done.                                                                                             \n    [iota interceptor] 2019/06/03 12:56:54 iota API call interception configured with max bundle txs limit of 20 and max MWM of 14   \n    [iota interceptor] 2019/06/03 12:56:54 using PoW implementation: SyncAVX                                                                             \n    Serving HTTPS on port 15265                                                                                                      \n    http://127.0.0.1:15265\n    ```\n\n    :::warning:\n    If you close the command-line interface, the PoW proxy will shut it down. To make sure that it always runs, you can run it as a service.\n    :::\n\n8. Send a transaction to your local PoW proxy server\n\n    ```js\n    // Require the packages\n    const Iota = require('@iota/core');\n    const Converter = require('@iota/converter');\n\n    // Create a new instance of the IOTA object\n    // Use the `provider` field to specify which IRI node to connect to\n    const iota = Iota.composeAPI({\n    provider: 'http://127.0.0.1:15265'\n    });\n\n    const address = 'HELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDD';\n\n    const seed = 'PUEOTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX';\n\n    const message = Converter.asciiToTrytes('Hello World!');\n    const transfers = [\n    {\n    value: 0,\n    address: address,\n    message: message\n    }\n    ];\n\n    iota.prepareTransfers(seed, transfers)\n    .then(trytes => {\n    return iota.sendTrytes(trytes, 3/*depth*/, 9/*MWM*/)\n    })\n    .then(bundle => {\n    var JSONBundle = JSON.stringify(bundle,null,1);\n    console.log(`Bundle: ${JSONBundle}`)\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n    // Catch any errors\n    console.log(error);\n    });\n    ```\n\n    You should see that the PoW proxy server handles the `attachToTangle` endpoint and logs it to the console:\n\n    ```\n    [iota interceptor] 2019/07/17 11:16:15 new attachToTangle request from 127.0.0.1:63167\n    [iota interceptor] 2019/07/17 11:16:15 bundle: SBEKOAJCN9NZOECDIIYYAUBZBTGPEIFLUIGTDU9EGDEVS9TGPTGQLFJAFXZBIHLRWLTAZLALRXOFOPTXB\n    [iota interceptor] 2019/07/17 11:16:15 doing PoW for bundle with 1 txs...\n    [iota interceptor] 2019/07/17 11:16:15 took 17ms to do PoW for bundle with 1 txs\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    Caddy saves a log of all requests in the `requests.log` file.\n    :::\n\n:::success:Congratulations :tada:\nYou have a dedicated proxy server that handles proof of work for your transactions.\n:::\n\n","title":"PoW プロキシサーバー入門 | Pow プロキシサーバー | 公式サポート | ユーティリティ"}}
