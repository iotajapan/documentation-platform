If your address contains 90 trytes, the last 9 trytes are the checksum, remove them.\n\n## 400: Invalid depth input\n\nMake sure that the value of the `depth` parameter is a number (not a string).\n\nDecrement the value of the `depth` parameter. The IRI node may limit the maximum accepted value.\n\nIf you're making the request to your own IRI node, check the [`MAX-DEPTH`](../references/iri-configuration-options.md#maxdepth) configuration option.\n\n## 400: Invalid parameters\n\nCheck the spelling of the parameters.\n\nMake sure that the parameters are in the correct order.\n\n## 400: One of the tips is absent\n\nThe IRI node doesn't have the tip transaction in its ledger.\n\nUse a different tip transaction as a parameter, or try making the request to a different IRI node.\n\n## 401: COMMAND is not available on this node\n\nMake the request to a different IRI node. The current IRI node has restricted requests to this endpoint.\n\nIf you're making the request to your own IRI node, make sure that the command is not listed in the [`REMOTE-LIMIT-API`](../references/iri-configuration-options.md#remote-limit-api) configuration option.\n","title":"APIエラー | 参考文献 | IRI"}}
