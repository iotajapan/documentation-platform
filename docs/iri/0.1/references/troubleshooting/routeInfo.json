Wait a while to see if the IRI synchronizes by itself.\n\n* [Make sure that you have 6 or 7 neighbors](../how-to-guides/find-neighbor-iri-nodes.md)\n\n* Make sure that you're running the [latest version of the IRI](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases)\n\n* Make sure that the IRI and its neighbors are sending data among each other. Call the getNeighbors API method to see both the incoming transactions (`numberOfAllTransactions`) and the number of outgoing transactions (`numberOfSentTransactions`). If your neighbors aren't sending you data, find new neighbors to connect to.\n\n    ```bash\n    curl http://localhost:14265 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-IOTA-API-Version: 1' -d '{\"command\": \"getNeighbors\"}'\n    ```\n\n* Ask for more support on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/fNGZXvh) in our #help and #fullnodes channels\n\n:::info:\nYou can download the latest database files from [dbfiles.iota.org](https://dbfiles.iota.org/?prefix=).\nBy downloading and extracting the latest database files, your node can synchronize faster with its neighbors.\n:::","title":"Troubleshooting | References | IRI"}}
