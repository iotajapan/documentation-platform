To stop the ledger from becoming too large, you can choose to delete old transactions from the ledger at regular intervals.**\n\nTransactions are pruned only if they were confirmed by a milestone transaction that is older than the result of the following calculation:\n\ncurrent milestone index - ([`LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_DEPTH`](../references/iri-configuration-options.md#local-snapshots-depth) +\n[`LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_PRUNING_DELAY`](../references/iri-configuration-options.md#local-snapshots-pruning-delay))\n\n## Configure your node\n\nYou must stop the IRI before making changes to the configuration options.\n\n1. Make sure that the `LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_ENABLED` and the `LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_PRUNING_ENABLED` configuration options are set to `true`\n\n2. Change the value of the `LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_PRUNING_DELAY` and the `LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_DEPTH` configuration options\n\nMilestones are sent approximately every two minute. So, use the following formula to calculate the number of days that new transactions will remain in the ledger:\n\n* **Total milestone index:** `LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_PRUNING_DELAY` + `LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_DEPTH` \n\n* **Total amount of time in minutes:** Total milestone index / 120\n\n* **Total amount of time in days:** Total amount of time in minutes / 24","title":"Prune transactions from the ledger | How-to Guides | IRI"}}
