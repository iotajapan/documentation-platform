The data in the ledger is a complete history of all the valid transactions that an IRI node has seen.\n\n## Ledger synchronization\n\nWhen an IRI node starts running, it synchronizes its ledger by solidifying every transaction that approves each milestone, starting from an **entry point milestone** and ending at the latest milestone.\n\nThe older the entry point milestone, the longer synchronization takes.\n\n<dl><dt>solidify</dt><dd>Request transactions from neighbor IRI nodes until all transactions and their history are stored in the ledger.</dd></dl>\n\nAn IRI node is considered synchronized when its `latestMilestoneIndex` field is equal to the `latestSolidSubtangleMilestoneIndex` field.\n\nThe `latestMilestoneIndex` field is the index of the latest milestone that the IRI has received from its neighbors.\n\nThe `latestSolidSubtangleMilestoneIndex` field is the index of the latest milestone for which the IRI node has all the transactions that the milestone directly and indirectly references.\n\n:::info:\nThe `getNodeInfo` API endpoint returns this information.
