Computers that run the IRI are called IRI nodes.**\n\nIRI nodes are the core of an IOTA network, and are responsible for the following key functions:\n\n- [Validate transactions](../concepts/transaction-validation.md)\n- [Store valid transactions in a ledger](../concepts/the-ledger.md)\n- [Allow clients to interact with the IRI](../how-to-guides/interact-with-an-iri-node.md) and have their transactions appended to the ledger\n\nWithout IRI nodes, IOTA networks wouldn't exist. No one would be able to send transactions because there would be no way of recording who sent what to whom.\n\nBy running your own IRI node you have the following benefits:\n\n- You have direct access to an IOTA network instead of having to connect to someone else's IRI node\n- You help the IOTA network to become more distributed by adding to the number of ledgers and validating your neighbor IRI node's transactions\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe IRI receives transactions and records them in its ledger, it doesn't create or sign transactions. To create or sign transactions, you must use client software such as [Trinity](/docs/trinity/0.1/introduction/overview) or a [client library](/docs/client-libraries/0.1/introduction/overview) and send the transactions to an IRI node.\n","title":"概要 | 序説 | IRI"}}
