Sweeps are an optional safety feature that reduces the likelihood of an attacker stealing tokens from a spent address.**\n\nIOTA uses the Winternitz one-time signature scheme to create signatures. As a result, each signature exposes around half of the private key. Signing a bundle once with the a private key is safe. Signing a different bundle with the same private key may allow attackers to brute force the private key and steal IOTA tokens from the address. So, when a user withdraws from an address, that address is considered 'used' and must never be withdrawn from again.\n\nIf a user deposits IOTA tokens into a spent address such as one involved in a sweep, the tokens in that address are at risk of being stolen.\n\nHub reduces this risk by transferring IOTA tokens from users' deposit addresses to a Hub owner's address at regular intervals.\n\n:::danger:Important\nYou shouldn't rely on sweeps to protect spent addresses. An attacker could steal the funds before Hub can do a sweep.\n\nSo, it's important that you inform users never to deposit tokens into a spent address.\n:::\n\n:::info:\n[Discover the details about spent addresses and why you must never withdraw from an address more than once](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/addresses-and-signatures#address-reuse).\n:::\n\nTo do a sweep, Hub does the following at regular intervals that are defined by the [`--monitorInterval` and `--sweepInterval`](../references/command-line-flags.md#monitorInterval) flags:\n\n- Find all deposit address that have a non-zero balance\n\n- Check whether those deposit addresses are in any pending bundles. Any deposit addresses that are in pending bundles aren't included in the sweep.\n\n- Check for pending user withdrawal requests\n\n- Create a new address for the Hub owner\n\n- Create a bundle that actions withdrawal requests and sends the remaining balance to the Hub owner's addresses. The number of deposits and withdrawals that can be actioned in a single bundle is limited by the [`--sweep_max_deposit` and `--sweep_max_withdrawal`](../references/command-line-flags.md#sweepLimits) flags.\n\n- Check the inclusion state of the tail transaction in the sweep to determine if it's been confirmed. Hub will [reattach and promote](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/reattach-rebroadcast-promote) the tail transaction until the transactions in the sweep are confirmed.\n\n- Update the users' balances in the database tables when the transactions in the sweep are confirmed\n\n:::info:Want to learn more about inclusion states?\nFind out how to [check if a transaction is confirmed](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/how-to-guides/check-transaction-confirmation).\n:::\n","title":"Sweeps | Concepts | Hub"}}
