Some of the data in these tables isn't exposed to the gRPC API. For example, you may want to find out the seed UUID for an address so that you can recreate the seed. This guide shows you the basics to get started with querying the Hub database tables.**\n\n:::info:\nThis guide assumes that you installed Hub with a MYSQL database such as MariaDB, which is the one we use in our installation guide.\n:::\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n[Create a user who has a deposit address](../how-to-guides/get-started-with-the-api.md).\n\n---\n\n1. Connect to the MYSQL\n\n    ```sql\n    mysql -u root -p\n    ```\n\n2. Select the `hub` database\n\n    ```sql\n    USE hub\n    ```\n\n3. Display a list of all the tables in the database\n\n    ```sql\n    SHOW TABLES;\n    ```\n\n4. Display information about your users' addresses and their associated seed UUIDs\n\n    ```sql\n    SELECT * from user_address;\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    To display data from another table, replace `user_address` with the name of that table.\n    :::\n\n    You should see something like the following:\n\n    ```sql\n    | id | address | user_id | seed_uuid | created_at | balance |\n    +----+---------+---------+-----------+-------------+--------+\n    |  1 | RPMENBAM9QOGSCMPIMHLFB9SCCUEUIYM9ODNXYZBUGB9PVZJTSNEZRLJXIPAAJDQTZMJSTDLFUHR9JFSD | 1 | Fnb3MRpr8gacuh1n1CMQQja5Dr53rCqrs4i9kiw0wYysft2d7vzjaPHJRAHjIkPd | 2019-03-28 13:38:48 |       0 |\n    |  2 | DAUBDIQEAOMNWYL9OLBQUABXIHVEDWEBFPPZCSVUS9HIKWFUSGHLAULFNFWPFQUHCIFKPRRZVFAGBBFJZ |       2 | TqHIfR0GCIKJPCZ8Q2z6UUQcJi4McGuUjJpkNloDR28cIL7hrMZDtQNAtTqyT2bJ | 2019-04-01 13:39:55 |       0 |\n    |  3 | S9OEPEMNSYOZKHPUDWCSH9KJDLDLWHTCNIHBDRTCQHFERTEABJVMRHUX9MIBGCYJINTSAWHVDFFXIIAFA |       2 | N5WrisKpidnvrYSr0aSxtncRr0SH8kUHJfYPEKNZU7DjO2XjL24cxRg6RBTMLpY | 2019-04-01 13:49:43 |       0 |\n    +----+--------+---------+-----------------+----------+-------+\n    ```\n\n5.
