You must take steps to secure Hub and use it correctly.**\n\n## Deposit addresses\n\nFor [security purposes](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/addresses-and-signatures#address-reuse), deposit addresses may only be withdrawn from once.\n\nHub reduces this risk by transferring IOTA tokens from users' deposit addresses to a Hub owner's address at regular intervals. This process happens in a [sweep](../concepts/sweeps.md).\n\n:::danger:Important\nYou shouldn't rely on sweeps to protect spent addresses. An attacker could steal the funds before Hub can do a sweep.\n\nSo, it's important that you inform users never to deposit tokens into a spent address.\n:::\n\n## Salt\n\nTo add an extra layer of security, improve the strength of your seed encryption algortithm by setting the [`salt`](../references/command-line-flags.md) flag. A salt removes the ability for an attacker to check the seed UUIDs in the database against a pre-computed dictionary attack. \n\n## Signing server\n\nTo help prevent theft, Hub offers two servers:\n\n* **Hub:** Manages accounts and addresses\n* **Signing server:** Stores the salt and signs bundles for sweeps.\n\nFor maximum security, run the signing server in a remote location so that, if Hub is compromised, attackers can't steal IOTA tokens without access to the signing server.\n\n## History logs\n\nHub generates a log of all its actions. This log also contains transaction records, server restarts, and other detailed information. \n","title":"Security considerations | References | Hub"}}
