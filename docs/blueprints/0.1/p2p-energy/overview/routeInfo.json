By creating a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy grid with IOTA, you can automate the transfer of power and the payment for that power. This automation makes your infrastructure more dynamic and easier to update.**\n\nThis blueprint demonstrates how entities in a P2P energy grid can trade energy. The distributed and machine-based nature of the P2P energy grid make this an ideal use case for IOTA. Using IOTA technologies, you can create an infrastructure where even low-powered devices can communicate with the grid in a traceable and immutable way.\n\nTrading energy on a P2P energy grid involves four high-level entities:\n\n**Entity** | **Role**\n---|---\n**Source**|Generate electricity such as solar or wind for a producer|\n**Producer**| Manage several sources and receive payment from the grid\n**Consumer** |Use the power provided by the grid in return for payment|\n**Grid**| Coordinate the distribution of power from the producers to the consumers, and distribute payments|\n \n\n![P2P Energy PoC - Use Case Picture](/assets/docs/blueprints/0.1/images/p2p_use_case.png)\n\n:::info:\nThis blueprint can be replicated in any scenario where a resource is distributed to consumers in return for payment, for example water supply.\n:::\n\n## Additional resources\n\n---------------\n#### iota.js client library ####\n[Link](/docs/iota-js/0.1/README)\n\nLearn how to use the iota.js client library to create, send, and receive transactions.\n---\n#### MAM eloquently explained ####\n[Link](https://blog.iota.org/introducing-masked-authenticated-messaging-e55c1822d50e)\n\nMasked Authenticated Messaging is a second layer data communication protocol that adds functionality to publish and control access to an encrypted data stream, over the Tangle.
