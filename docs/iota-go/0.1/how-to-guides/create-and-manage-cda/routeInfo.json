CDAs are special addresses that allow you to specify the conditions in which they may be used in account withdrawals and deposits.**\n\nAccounts use CDAs to reduce the [risks associated with spent addresses](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/addresses-and-signatures#address-reuse). When you request IOTA tokens from a someone, you can create a CDA that's active for a certain period of time. This way, you let the sender know that you intend to withdraw from that address only after that time. As a result, the sender can decide whether to make a deposit, depending on how much time is left on a CDA.\n\n:::info:\nCDAs can be used only in an account and not in the generic [client library methods](/docs/client-libraries/0.1/introduction/overview). As a result, both you and the sender must have an account to be able to use CDAs.\n:::\n\n## Create a CDA\n\nTo create a CDA, specify the following condition, which defines whether it's active or expired:\n\n* **timeout_at (required):** The time at which the address expires\n\nAnd one of the following, recommended fields:\n\n* **multi_use (recommended):** A boolean that specifies if the address may be sent more than one deposit.\n* **expected_amount (recommended):** The amount of IOTA tokens that the address is expected to contain. When the address contains this amount, it's considered expired. We highly recommend using this condition.\n\n:::info:\nYou can't specify the `expected_amount` and `multi_use` fields in the same CDA. Please refer to the [FAQ](../references/cda-faq.md) for more information.\n:::\n\n|  **Combination of fields** | **Withdrawal conditions**\n| :----------| :----------|\n|`timeout_at` |The CDA can used in withdrawals as long as it contains IOTA tokens|\n|`timeout_at` and `multi_use` (recommended) |The CDA can be used in withdrawals as soon as it expires, regardless of how many deposits were made to it. See the [CDA FAQ](../references/cda-faq.md) on when to use addresses with the `multi_use` field set. |\n|`timeout_at` and `expected_amount` (recommended) | The CDA can be used in withdrawals as soon as it contain the expected amount. See the [CDA FAQ](../references/cda-faq.md) on when to use addresses with the `multi_use` field set.|\n\n:::warning:Warning\nIf a CDA was created with only the `timeout_at` field, it can be used in withdrawals as soon as it has a non-zero balance even if it hasn't expired. \n\nTo avoid withdrawing from a spent address, we recommend creating CDAs with either the `multi_use` field or with the `expected_amount` field whenever possible.\n:::\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n[Create a new account](../how-to-guides/create-account.md).\n\n## Create a new CDA\n\n1. Store the current time from your account's timesource object\n\n    ```go\n    // get current time\n    now, err := timesource.Time()\n    handleErr(err)\n    ```\n\n2. Define an expiration time for the CDA\n\n    ```go\n    // define the time after which the CDA expires\n    // (in this case after 72 hours)\n    now = now.Add(time.Duration(72) * time.Hour)\n    ```\n\n3. Create a new multi-use CDA with an expiration time\n\n    ```go\n    // allocate a new deposit address with timeout conditions.\n    conditions := &deposit.Request{TimeoutAt: &now, MultiUse: true}\n    cda, err := acc.AllocateDepositRequest(conditions)\n    handleErr(err)\n    ```\n\n### Create an oracle\n\nA CDA may expire during the time it takes for a bundle to be created, sent, and confirmed. So, you need to make a decision about whether to deposit into a CDA, depending on its conditions. To automate this decision-making process, you can create an [oracle](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/tree/master/account/oracle) that returns a decision (true or false) about whether to deposit into it.\n\nOracles take an oracle source as an argument and return `true` if the oracle source decides that you may deposit into the CDA.\n\n1. Use the [`TimeDecider` oracle source](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/tree/master/account/oracle/time) to check if the CDA's expiration time is at least 30 minutes away. These 30 minutes give the bundle time to be sent and confirmed.\n\n    ```go\n    threshold := time.Duration(30)*time.Minute\n    // timeDecider is an OracleSource\n    timeDecider := oracle_time.NewTimeDecider(timesource, threshold)\n    // Create a new SendOracle with the given OracleSources\n    sendOracle := oracle.New(timeDecider)\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    To avoid conflicts with the `time` package, you must add a prefix to the `\"github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/account/oracle\"` import. In this example, we use the `oracle_time` prefix.\n    :::\n\n2. To call the oracle, pass the CDA to the `OkToSend()` method of the `sendOracle` object\n\n    ```go\n    // Ask the SendOracle whether we should make a deposit\n    ok, rejectionInfo, err := sendOracle.OkToSend(cda)\n    handleErr(err)\n    if !ok {\n        fmt.Println(\"Won't send transaction: \", rejectionInfo)\n        return\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Deposit IOTA tokens into a CDA\n\n1. When a CDA contains an expected amount, you can deposit that amount into it by passing the object to the `account.Send()` method.\n    \n    ```go\n    bundle, err := account.Send(cda.AsTransfer())\n    handleErr(err)\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"Made deposit into %s in the bundle with the following tail transaction hash %s\\n\", cda.Address, bundle[0].Hash)\n    ```\n\n:::info:\nIf you're testing your account on the Devnet and you don't have enough balance, use the [Devnet faucet](https://faucet.devnet.iota.org/) to request Devnet tokens.\n:::\n\n## Distribute a CDA\n\nBecause CDAs are descriptive objects, you can serialize them into any format and distribute them. For example, you can create a magnet-link for a CDA, with the `timeout_at`, `multi_use`, and `expected_amount` parameters.\n\n1. To serialize the CDA into a magent link, use the `AsMagnetLink()` method of the CDA object\n\n    ```go\n    fmt.Println(cda.AsMagnetLink())\n    // iota://MBREWACWIPRFJRDYYHAAMEâ€¦AMOIDZCYKW/?timeout_at=1548337187&multi_use=1&expected_amount=0\n    ```\n\n2. To parse the magnet link into a CDA, use the `ParseMagnetLink()` method of the `deposit` object\n\n    ```go\n    cda, err := deposit.ParseMagnetLink(cdaMagnetLink)\n    handleErr(err)\n    ```\n\n## Next steps\n\n[Listen to events in your account](../how-to-guides/listen-to-events.md).","title":"Send and receive transactions | How-to Guides | IOTA Go"}}
