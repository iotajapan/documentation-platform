Addresses are the accounts that hold IOTA tokens and signatures prove ownership of an address.**\n\nTo use an IOTA network, clients must [create a seed and keep it private](/docs/getting-started/0.1/tutorials/get-started). A seed is a string of 81 [trytes](../references/tryte-alphabet.md) that gives a client access to addresses.  \n \nSeeds are the master keys to the cryptographic hashing function in the IOTA protocol. Each seed can derive an almost unlimited number of unique private keys and addresses (9<sup>57</sup>).\n\nEach private key is unique to a seed, index, and security level, and can be used to derive one corresponding address. A private key and an address can be thought of as a pair. Addresses are public and clients can send IOTA tokens and messages to them using the [`address` field] of a transaction. A private key is private and is used to sign bundles that withdraw IOTA tokens from the address.\n\nEach pair of private keys and addresses has its own index and [security level](../references/security-levels.md). The security level affects the length of the private key. The greater the security level, the longer the private key, and the more secure a transaction's signature.\n\nIn IOTA, multiple pairs of private keys and addresses are needed because [each address can be withdrawn from (spent) only once](#address-reuse). So, each time you withdraw from an address, you must [create a new address](../how-to-guides/create-an-address.md) by either incrementing the index or changing the security level.\n\n:::info:\nThe greater the security level of a private key and address pair, the more difficult it is for an attacker to brute force the signature of a spent address.\n:::\n\n:::warning:Keep seeds and private keys secure\nA seed is the key to all your private keys and addresses. And, a private key is the key to one address.\n\nYou must keep your seeds and private keys secure.\n:::\n\n### How private keys are derived\n\nEach private key is derived from a cryptographic hashing function that takes a seed, an index, and a security level. \n\nThe seed and index are combined and hashed, using the [Keccak-384 hashing function](https://keccak.team/keccak.html) to derive an 81-tryte **subseed**:\n\n    hash(seed + index)\n\nTo derive a private key, the subseed is passed to a [cryptographic sponge function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge_function), which absorbs it and squeezes it 27 times per security level.\n\nThe result of the sponge function is a private key that consists of 2,187, 4,374, or 6,561 trytes, depending on the [security level](../references/security-levels.md).\n\n### How addresses are derived\n\nTo derive an address, the private key is split into **81-tryte segments**. Then, each segment is hashed 26 times. A group of 27 hashed segments is called a **key fragment**.\n\nBecause a private key consists of 2,187, 4,374, or 6,561 trytes, a private key has one key fragments for each security level. For example, a private key with security level 1 consists of 2,187 trytes, which is 27 segments, which results in one key fragment.\n\nEach key fragment is hashed once to derive one **key digest** for each security level. For example, one key fragment results in one key digest.\n\nThen, the key digests are combined and hashed once to derive an 81-tryte address.\n\n:::info:Want to try this out?\nUse the JavaScript client library to [derive addresses from private keys](../how-to-guides/derive-addresses-from-private-keys.md).\n:::\n\n![Address generation](/assets/docs/iota-basics/0.1/images/address-generation.png)\n\n### How private keys sign bundles\n\nPrivate keys sign the bundle hash of the transaction that withdraws from the address and put that signature in the [`signatureMessageFragment` field](../references/structure-of-a-transaction.md) of the transaction.\n\nBy signing the bundle hash, it's impossible for attackers to intercept a bundle and change any transaction without changing the bundle hash and invalidating the signature.\n\nSignatures are created using the Winternitz one-time signature scheme (W-OTS). This signature scheme is quantum resistant, meaning that signatures are resistant to attacks from [quantum computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing).\n\nTo sign a bundle hash, first it's normalized to make sure that only half of the private key is revealed in the signature.\n\nIf the bundle hash weren't normalized, the W-OTS would reveal an unknown amount of the private key. By revealing half of the private key, an address can safely be withdrawn from once.\n<a id=\"address-reuse\"></a>\n\n:::danger:Spent addresses\nIf an address is withdrawn from (spent) more than once, more of the private key is revealed, so an attacker could brute force its signature and steal the IOTA tokens.\n:::\n\nDepending on the number of key fragments that a private key has, 27, 54, or 81 trytes of the normalized bundle hash are selected. These trytes correspond to the number of segments in a key fragment.\n\nThe selected trytes of the normalized bundle hash are [converted to their decimal values](../references/tryte-alphabet.md). Then, the following calculation is performed on each of them:\n\n    13 - decimal value\n\nThe result of this calculation is the number of times that each of the 27 segments in the key fragment must be hashed to derive the signature fragment. Each signature fragment contains 2,187 trytes.\n\nBecause a transaction's [`signatureMessageFragment` field](../references/structure-of-a-transaction.md) can contain only 2187 trytes, any input address with a security level greater than 1 must fragment the rest of the signature over zero-value output transactions.\n\n### How nodes verify signatures\n\nNodes verify a signature in a transaction by using the signature and the bundle hash to find the address of the input transaction.\n\nTo verify a signature, the bundle hash of a transaction is normalized.\n\nDepending on the length of the signature, 27, 54, or 81 trytes of the normalized bundle hash are selected. These trytes correspond to the number of 81-tryte segments in a signature fragment.\n\nThe selected trytes of the normalized bundle hash are [converted to decimal values](../references/tryte-alphabet.md). Then, the following calculation is performed on each of them:\n\n    13 + decimal value\n\nThe result of this calculation is the number of times that each of the 27 segments in the signature fragments must be hashed to derive the key fragments.\n\nEach key fragment is hashed once to derive the **key digests**, which are combined and hashed once to derive an 81-tryte address.\n\nIf the address matches the one in the transaction, the signature is valid and the withdrawal is accepted.\n","title":"アドレスと署名 | コンセプト | IOTAの基本"}}
