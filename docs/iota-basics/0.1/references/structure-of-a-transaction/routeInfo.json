When decoded, the transaction object contains the following fields.\n\n| Field                         | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Length (trytes) |\n| :----------------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ |\n| `signatureMessageFragment`      | string | A signature or a message, both of which may be _fragmented_ over multiple transactions in the bundle. This field contains a signature if the transaction withdraws IOTA tokens. Otherwise, this field can contain a tryte-encoded message or all 9's where no message is defined. | 2187   |\n| `address`                       | string | Contains either the sender or recipient's address. This field contains a recipient's address if the transaction is an output. Otherwise, this field contains an address from which IOTA tokens are being withdrawn (transaction with a negative `value` field).   | 81     |\n| `value`                    | integer    | Amount of IOTA tokens to deposit to or withdraw from the address                                                                                                                                                                                            | 27     |\n| `obsoleteTag`                   | string | User-defined tag (soon to be removed)                                                                                                                                                                                               | 27     |\n| `timestamp`                     | integer    | Unix epoch: Seconds since Jan 1, 1970 (not-enforced and can be arbitrary)                                                                                                                                                                                    | 9      |\n| `currentIndex`                  | integer  | Index of a transaction in the bundle                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 9      |\n| `lastIndex`                     | integer    | Index of the last transaction in the bundle                                                                                                                                                                                           | 9      |\n| `bundle`                        | string | Hash of the bundle                                 | 81     |\n| `trunkTransaction`              | string |  Transaction hash of a parent transaction                                                                                                                                                                                 | 81     |\n| `branchTransaction`             | string | Transaction hash of a parent transaction                                                                                                                                                                   | 81     |\n| `attachmentTag`                | string | User-defined tag                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 27     |\n| `attachmentTimestamp`          | integer   | Unix epoch: Milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970 (after POW)                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 9      |\n| `attachmentTimestampLowerBound` | integer   | Lower limit of the `attachmentTimestamp` field (not currently used)                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 9      |\n| `attachmentTimestampUpperBound` | integer   | Upper limit of the `attachmentTimestamp` field (not currently used)                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 9      |\n| `nonce`                         | string | Trytes that represent the amount of times a transaction must be hashed to check the [proof of work](/docs/the-tangle/0.1/concepts/proof-of-work).                                      | 27     |\n","title":"Structure of a transaction | References | IOTAの基本"}}
