The greater the security level, the larger and more secure the signature of a spent address is against brute force attacks.**\n\nA greater security level means that more computations must be done to sign a transaction and that more transactions are needed in a bundle to contain the signature. As a result, low-powered devices may want to use security level 2, whereas a large-scale company may want to use security level 3.\n\n\n| **Security Level** | **Private key/signature length**                   |\n| :-------------- | :-------------------------- |\n| 1              | 2,187 (not recommended)|\n| 2              | 4,374 (used by Trinity)         |\n| 3              | 6,561 (most secure)           |\n","title":"Security levels | References | IOTA Basics"}}
