This software defines the current IOTA protocol, which allows clients to transfer the IOTA token among each other.\n\nhttps://github.com/iotaledger/compass\n\n- [**GoShimmer:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer) Go software that implements a prototype of an IOTA network without the Coordinator. This network is still in development, so not all functionality is ready.\n\n- [**Chronicle:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/chronicle) Elixir software that allows you to take all transactions from an IRI node and store them in a separate distributed database, which is secure and scalable\n\n- [**Hive.go:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/hive.go) Go software that contains features, which are shared by GoShimmer and the community-built [Hornet](https://github.com/gohornet/hornet) node software\n\n- [**Bee:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee) Rust software that is being developed as a successor to IRI\n\n### Simulators\n\nSimulators are programs that the Research Department use to test Coordicide modules.\n\n- [**Autopeering:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/autopeering-sim) Allows you to test autopeering by simulating many nodes connecting to each other\n\n- [**Fast Probabilistic Consensus:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/fpc-sim) Allows you to test the FPC protocol by simulating attacks\n\n### Client libraries\n\nClient libraries make it easy for you to integrate IOTA into your own applications. You can use them to create, send, receive, and request transactions.\n\n- [**C**](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.c)\n\n- [**Go**](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.go)\n\n- [**Java**](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-java)\n\n- [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js)\n\n- [**Python**](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.py)\n\n- [**Rust**](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs)\n\n### Wallets\n\nA wallet is an application that stores your seed and keeps a record of transactions in a database. You can use wallets to simplify the process of securing your seed, sending transactions, and managing your balance.\n\n- [**Hub:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/hub) A wallet management system for cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians, giving you a secure way to manage deposits and withdrawals of users' IOTA tokens\n\n- [**Spark:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/spark-wallet) A low-security wallet intended for short-term use and sending small amounts of IOTA tokens\n\n- [**Trinity wallet:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/trinity-wallet) The official wallet for IOTA with a user interface that allows you to transfer data and IOTA tokens\n\n## Second layer protocols\n\nSecond layer protocols build on the IOTA protocol to offer extended functionality.\n\n- [**Unified Identity Protocol:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.ts) A protocol for giving things, individuals, and organizations control of their identities and personal data\n\n- [**Masked Authenticated Messaging:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/mam.c) A protocol for sending encrypted streams of data over the Tangle\n\n### Utilities\n\nUtilities are open-source applications that you can either use to speed up development or adapt and include in your own applications.\n\n- [Tangle utilities](https://github.com/iotaledger/tangle-utils-website)\n\n- [Client load balancer](https://github.com/iotaledger/client-load-balancer)\n\n- [Trytes compressor](https://github.com/iotaledger/tryte-compress-js)\n\n- [IOTA area codes](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-area-codes)\n\n- [GitHub Tangle release](https://github.com/iotaledger/gh-tangle-release)\n\n- [Proof of existence](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-poex-tool)\n\n### Blueprint demos\n\nBlueprint demos are example applications of how IOTA technology can be used to solve real problems and to support well defined business needs.\n\n- [**Tangle data storage:**](https://github.com/iotaledger/poc-ipfs) Allows users to verify the contents of a file in a third-party storage solution\n\n- [Data Marketplace](https://github.com/iotaledger/data-marketplace) Allows users to pay for data in micropayments of IOTA tokens\n\n- [Industry Marketplace](https://github.com/iotaledger/industry-marketplace) Allows devices to buy and sell goods, data, and services in a vendor-neutral marketplace \n\n- [HyperLedger bridge](https://github.com/iotaledger/HyperledgerFabric-IOTA-Connector) Allows users to connect to trigger transactions on the Tangle, using HyperLedger smart contracts\n\n- [Container tracking](https://github.com/iotaledger/trade-poc) Allows users to track and trace assets in the supply chain\n\n## Getting started with your first contribution\n\nIn the `.github` directory of each IOTAledger repository is a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with advice for getting started.\n\nIf you are unsure where to begin, you can start by looking any `beginner` or `help-wanted` issues.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [IOTA Code of Conduct](https://www.iota.org/contact-us/community-support).\n\n","title":"Contribute to a repository | IOTAledger | 貢献"}}
