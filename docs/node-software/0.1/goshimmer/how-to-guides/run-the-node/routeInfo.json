By running a node, you can test the network and keep up to date with regular changes. When all the modules become available, this network will become the Coordicide testnet, which is a release candidate for the next IOTA protocol.**\n\nYou have two options for running a node. You either can run the node as a service in a Docker container, or you can run the node on the file system of your local device.\n\n## Run the node in a Docker container\n\nWhen you run a node in a Docker container, it includes all the necessary dependencies that you need to run a node. For example, GCC and the Go programming language.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this guide, you need the following:\n\n* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n* An Internet connection\n* [Forward the ports](/docs/general/0.1/how-to-guides/expose-your-local-device) 14626 and 14666 to the device that's running the node\n* A [public IP address](/docs/general/0.1/how-to-guides/expose-your-local-device) that's either static or connected to a dynamic DNS service such as [duckdns.org](https://www.duckdns.org)\n* [A system architecture that Docker supports](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms)\n\nThe Docker container is suitable for the following operating systems:\n* Linux\n* macOS\n* Windows\n\n:::info:\nIf you're using a Debian-based operating system, add `sudo` before all the commands in the following tasks.\n:::\n\n### Step 1. Install Docker\n\nTo build the Docker container, you must install Docker 17.05+ (for multi-stage build support) on your device.\n\n1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms). If you're running a version of macOS or Windows that's older than the system requirements, install the [Docker toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/) instead.\n\n2. Make sure that Docker is installed\n\n    ```bash\n    docker run hello-world\n    ```\n\n    You should see some Docker information like the following:\n\n    ```\n    Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally\n    latest: Pulling from library/hello-world\n    1b930d010525: Pull complete\n    Digest: sha256:2557e3c07ed1e38f26e389462d03ed943586f744621577a99efb77324b0fe535\n    Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest\n\n    Hello from Docker!\n    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\n\n    To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:\n    1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.\n    2. The Docker daemon pulled the \"hello-world\" image from the Docker Hub.\n        (amd64)\n    3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the\n        executable that produces the output you are currently reading.\n    4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it\n        to your terminal.\n\n    To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:\n    docker run -it ubuntu bash\n\n    Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:\n    https://hub.docker.com/\n\n    For more examples and ideas, visit:\n    https://docs.docker.com/get-started/\n    ```\n\n### Step 2. Run the node\n\nWhen you run the node, it joins the network by autopeering with the entry node that's run by us at the IOTA Foundation. To autopeer with this entry node, you must make sure that the autopeering and gossip ports are forwarded to your node. By default, these ports are 14666 and 14626. If you don't forward these ports, you can still send transaction to your node, but it won't be able to connect to any neighbors.\n\n1. Clone the `goshimmer` repository\n    \n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer.git\n    ```\n\n2. Change into the `goshimmer` directory\n\n    ```bash\n    cd goshimmer\n    ```\n\n3. Build the Docker image\n\n    ```bash\n    docker build -t goshimmer .\n    ```\n\n4. Run the Docker image\n\n    ```bash\n    docker run --rm -it -v target/mainnetdb:/root/mainnetdb goshimmer\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    You can customize some features of your node by adding [command-line flags](../references/command-line-flags.md) after the `run` command.\n\n    To have the Docker container restart on every reboot, add the `--restart=always` flag to the `run` command.\n   :::\n\n:::success:Congratulations :tada:\nYou're now running a GoShimmer.\n:::\n\n![GoShimmer user interface](/assets/docs/node-software/0.1/goshimmer/images/goshimmer.png)\n\nThe user interface displays the following statistics in the top-right corner:\n\n* **TPS:** The number of transactions per second, which are separated into two categories. The **received** transactions are those that the node has just appended to its ledger. The **new** transactions are solid transactions.\n* **Node ID:** The node's public key that gives it a unique identity\n* **Neighbors:** The number of neighbors that the node is connected to. All nodes can have a maximum of 8 neighbors. Each node chooses 4 neighbors to connect to and accepts incoming connections from 4 other neighbors that chose it.\n* **Known peers:** The total number of nodes in the network. At the moment, the number of **neighborhood** nodes is the same as the number of **total** nodes. When the network allows sharding, the **neighborhood** nodes will be those that are in the node's shard.\n* **Uptime:** The total amount of time during which the node has been running\n\n## Run the node on your local device\n\nWhen you run a node on your local device, you need to make sure that it has the dependencies such as GCC, and the Go programming language.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this guide, you need the following:\n\n* At least version 1.12 of the Go programming language (we recommend the latest version)\n* GCC: For macOS, you can install GCC using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (`brew install gcc`). For Windows, you can [install TDM-GCC](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download). For Linux (Ubuntu 18.04), you can [install GCC from the `build-essential` package](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-gcc-compiler-on-ubuntu-18-04/).\n* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n* An Internet connection\n* [Forward the ports](/docs/general/0.1/how-to-guides/expose-your-local-device) 14626 and 14666 to the device that's running the node\n* A [public IP address](/docs/general/0.1/how-to-guides/expose-your-local-device) that's either static or connected to a dynamic DNS service such as [duckdns.org](https://www.duckdns.org)\n\n### Step 1. Download the code\n\n1. In the command prompt, check your `GOPATH` environment variable\n\n    ```bash\n    go env GOPATH\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    This directory is called `$GOPATH`.\n    :::\n\n2. Clone the `goshimmer` repository. Replace the `$GOPATH` placeholder with your own `$GOPATH` directory.\n    \n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer\n    ```\n\n3. Change into the `goshimmer` directory. Replace the `$GOPATH` placeholder with your own `$GOPATH` directory.\n\n    ```bash\n    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer\n    ```\n\n4. Install the dependencies\n\n    ```bash\n    go get\n    ```\n\n### Step 2. Run the node\n\nWhen you run the node, it joins the network by autopeering with the entry node that's run by us at the IOTA Foundation. To autopeer with this entry node, you must make sure that the autopeering and gossip ports are forwarded to your node. By default, these ports are 14666 and 14626. If you don't forward these ports, you can still send transaction to your node, but it won't be able to connect to any neighbors.\n\n1. Build the executable file\n\n    ```bash\n    go build -o shimmer\n    ```\n    \n    Now, you have a file called `shimmer` that you need to execute.\n\n2. To execute the `shimmer` file on Linux or macOS, do `./shimmer`. To execute the file on Windows, rename it to `shimmer.exe`, then execute it by double clicking the file, or by doing `.\\shimmer` in the command prompt.\n\n    :::info:\n    You can customize some features of your node by adding [command-line flags](../references/command-line-flags.md) after the command to execute the file.\n    :::\n\n    :::info:\n    If you see a `permission denied` error, try executing the file as an administrator.\n    :::\n\n:::success:Congratulations :tada:\nYou're now running a GoShimmer node.\n:::\n\n![GoShimmer user interface](/assets/docs/node-software/0.1/goshimmer/images/goshimmer.png)\n\nThe user interface displays the following statistics in the top-right corner:\n\n* **TPS:** The number of transactions per second, which are separated into two categories.

When the network allows sharding, the **neighborhood** nodes will be those that are in the node's shard.\n* **Uptime:** The total amount of time during which the node has been running\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that your node is running, you can [send it spam transactions](../how-to-guides/send-spam.md) to test how many transactions per second your node can process.\n\n","title":"GoShimmerノードを実行する | ハウツーガイド | GoShimmer | ノードソフトウェア"}}
