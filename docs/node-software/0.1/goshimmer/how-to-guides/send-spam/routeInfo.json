Open a web browser and enter the following into the address bar. If you want to access your node through the Internet, replace `localhost` with your IP address.\n\n    `http://localhost:8080/spammer?cmd=start`\n\n    :::info:\n    By default, this endpoint sends 1,000 transactions per second (TPS). If you want to change the TPS, you can add the `tps` query parameter. For example, to send 10,000 TPS, send a request to the following endpoint `http://localhost:8080/spammer?cmd=start&tps=10000`\n    :::\n\n2. To check that your node is receiving transactions, see the statistics in the top-right of the user interface\n\n    :::info:\n    The displayed TPS may be lower than the value of the `tps` parameter you used. The reason for this difference may be due to limits with your computer hardware.\n    :::\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that your node is receiving transactions, you can [subscribe to the transaction event](../how-to-guides/subscribe-to-events.md) on your node to see that data.","title":"ノードにスパムトランザクションを送信する | ハウツーガイド | GoShimmer | ノードソフトウェア"}}
