This software gives nodes read/write access to the Tangle and allows them to validate transactions and store them in their ledgers.**\n\n-------------------------\n![IRI](/assets/docs/node-software/0.1/images/IRI.png)\n## [IRI](../iri/introduction/overview.md)\nThe IRI (IOTA reference implementation) is open-source Java software that runs on the IOTA Mainnet. This software defines the current IOTA protocol, which allows clients to transfer the IOTA token among each other.\n-------------------------\n\n-------------------------\n![GoShimmer](/assets/docs/node-software/0.1/images/GoShimmer.png)\n## [GoShimmer](../goshimmer/introduction/overview.md)\nGoShimmer is open-source Go software that implements a prototype of an IOTA network without the Coordinator. This network is still in development, so not all modules exist, but new ones will be added when they are ready.\n-------------------------\n","title":"概要 | 序説 | ノードソフトウェア"}}
