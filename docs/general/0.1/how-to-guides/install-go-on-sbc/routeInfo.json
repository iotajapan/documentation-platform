Check your system architecture\n\n    ```bash\n    uname -i\n    ```\n\n2. Download the [Go source and binary files](https://golang.org/dl/) for your system architecture\n\n3. Move the Go source and binary files\n    \n    ```bash\n    sudo mv go /usr/local/\n    ```\n\n4. Create the `go` directories. Replace the `$USERNAME` placeholder with your current Linux username.\n    \n    ```bash\n    sudo mkdir -p ~/$USERNAME/go/src\n    sudo mkdir ~/$USERNAME/go/bin\n    sudo mkdir ~/$USERNAME/go/pkg\n    ```\n\n5. Open your environment variables file\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo nano /etc/environment\n    ```\n\n6. Add the Go install directory to your environment variables file. Replace the `$USERNAME` placeholder with your current Linux username.\n    \n    ```bash\n    GOROOT=/usr/local/go\n    GOPATH=~/[USERNAME]/go\n    ```\n\n7. Create soft links to the Go binary files\n    \n    ```bash\n    ln -s /usr/bin/go /usr/local/go/bin/go\n    ln -s /usr/local/go/bin/gofmt /usr/bin/gofmt\n    ```\n\n8. Check that Go is installed\n    \n    ```bash\n    go version\n    ```\n    \n    You should see a version number. If not, try installing Go again.\n\n:::success:Congratulation :tada:\nYou've installed Go on your SBC. Now, you can start creating or using applications written in the Go programming language.\n:::\n","title":"Install Go on a single-board computer | How-to Guides | 一般"}}
