You do this so that the node can walk on the connections to find and validate each transaction. These connections form a data structure that's called the Tangle. Transactions in the Tangle can be in one of two states: Pending or confirmed.**\n\nThis model forms a type of [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG), in which each transaction represents a vertex.\n\n![A directed acyclic graph](/assets/docs/getting-started/0.1/images/dag.png)\n\nIn this diagram, transaction 5 is attached to transactions 2 and 3. So, transaction 5 **directly** references transactions 2 and 3.\n\nTransaction 6 is attached to transaction 5 (and another transaction that's not shown). So, transaction 6 **indirectly** references transaction 3 (through transaction 5).\n\n## How a transaction becomes confirmed\n\nWhen you send a transfer bundle to a node, it doesn't update the balances of the affected addresses straight away.\n\nNodes do not transfer IOTA tokens until all transactions in the bundle are confirmed.\n\nTo go from a pending state to a confirmed state, nodes must reach consensus on the state of a transaction.\n\nAt the moment, nodes reach a consensus on transactions that are **directly or indirectly referenced by a milestone** (transaction that's created and sent by the Coordinator).\n\n:::info:\nIf transaction 6 were a milestone, then transaction 5, 3, 2, and 1 would all be confirmed and considered final.\n::: \n\nLearn more about [the Coordinator](/docs/the-tangle/0.1/concepts/the-coordinator), [tip selection](/docs/the-tangle/0.1/concepts/tip-selection).\n\n","title":"タングルとは？ | 前置き | 入門"}}
