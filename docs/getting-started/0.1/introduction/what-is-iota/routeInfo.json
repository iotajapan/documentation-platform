The transactions in a bundle instruct the node to transfer IOTA tokens from one address to another. These addresses are derived from a client's unique secret password called a [seed](../introduction/what-is-a-seed.md).\n\nWhen the bundle is confirmed in [the Tangle](../introduction/what-is-the-tangle.md), the IOTA tokens are transferred.\n\n## What is the IOTA token?\n\nAt its most basic level, the IOTA token is a record of ownership that's held by the nodes in an IOTA network.\n\n    ADDRESS....ENDOFADDRESS;1000\n\nThese characters might look cryptic, but let's break it down. On the left of the semicolon is an address. These are unique to each client in the network. On the right of the semicolon is an amount of IOTA tokens that belong to that address, in this case 1,000 tokens.\n\nYou own IOTA tokens only when all nodes [validate the transaction](/docs/iri/0.1/concepts/transaction-validation) that sent the tokens to you, and when it's referenced by a milestone.\n\n## What makes the IOTA token valuable?\n\nThe IOTA token is valuable for the following reasons:\n\n* **It's finite:** All nodes agree that a maximum of 2,779,530,283 277,761 tokens exist in the network. This maximum number is built into the network and can't ever be changed.\n* **It's useful:** To transfer value in an IOTA network, you must use the IOTA token. \n\n## What are the benefits of IOTA?\n\nIOTA is an open-source technology that can streamline, secure, and automate any process that sends data or transfers value among different devices.\n\n### Trust\n\nEach node in an IOTA network validates transactions, then sends them to other nodes that do the same. As a result, all valid transactions are agreed on by all nodes, removing the need to trust a single one in the network.\n\n### Immutability\n\nAll transactions in the ledger are immutable and transparent.\n\n### Security\n\nIOTA uses quantum-resistant cryptography to secure the network and prevent attackers from stealing IOTA tokens.\n\nIOTA networks are peer-to-peer networks. No central authority controls the ledger of transactions, instead all nodes hold a copy and run the software that contains the IOTA protocol to automate the agreement on its contents.\n\n### Cost saving\n\nIOTA is free to use. You don't need to pay a subscription, or sign a contract. Even transactions are free to send.\n\n### Scalability\n\nFor each transaction that's appended to the ledger, two previous transactions are validated. This process makes IOTA incredibly scalable because the more new transactions that propagate through the network, the faster other transactions are validated.\n\n## For what industries is IOTA useful?\nMany industries such as the following could benefit from using IOTA:\n\n* [Mobility](https://www.iota.org/verticals/mobility-automotive)\n* [Global trade and supply chains](https://www.iota.org/verticals/global-trade-supply-chains)\n* [Industrial IoT (Internet of things)](https://www.iota.org/verticals/industrial-iot)\n* [Healthcare](https://www.iota.org/verticals/ehealth)\n* [Energy](https://www.iota.org/verticals/smart-energy)\n\n\n## How do I get started?\n\n* [Start your IOTA journey](../tutorials/get-started.md)\n\n* Take a look at some [applications that are already using IOTA](../references/use-cases.md)\n","title":"What is IOTA? | Introduction | Getting Started"}}
