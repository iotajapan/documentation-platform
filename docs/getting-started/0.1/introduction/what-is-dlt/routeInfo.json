The purpose of a permissionless ledger is to allow anyone to contribute data to the ledger and for everyone in possession of the ledger to have identical copies. Nodes maintain the integrity of the ledger by reaching a consensus about its state. A permissionless ledger can be used as an immutable global record of transfers.\n* **Permissioned ledger:** A ledger that's distributed only among nodes that are preselected by a central authority such as a bank or a government.\n\n## What problems does DLT solve?\n\nWhen data is stored in proprietary databases, it's difficult to share that data with others without it becoming changed and lost in other databases.\n\nDLT creates a single source of truth that all participants can trust. When data is added to a distributed ledger, anyone with an internet connection can access it by connecting to any node in the network.\n\n## Next steps\n\n[Learn about IOTA](../introduction/what-is-iota.md).\n","title":"分散型台帳技術とは？ | 序説 | 入門"}}
