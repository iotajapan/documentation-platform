Nodes accept a certain minimum weight magnitude, depending on their configuration. If you use a minimum weight magnitude that is too low, nodes will reject the transaction as invalid.**\n\n## Advice for choosing a minimum weight magnitude\n\nWhen choosing a minimum weight magnitude, you should consider the following questions.\n\n### Which IOTA network are you using?\n\nAll nodes accept transactions whose hashes end in the same or higher number of 0 trits as their predefined MWM. If a transaction ends in fewer 0 trits than the MWM, the nodes in that network will reject it.\n\nFor example, on the Mainnet, you must use at least a MWM of 14. If you were to send a transaction whose hash ended in nine (the MWM on the Devnet) 0 trits, nodes on the Mainnet would not accept it. Those nodes would expect the transaction hash to end in at least fourteen 0 trits.\n\n### Are you testing IOTA?\n\nEvery increment of the MWM triples the difficulty of the PoW. As a result, if you're testing IOTA, you may want to use the Devnet where proof of work is quicker and easier to do.\n\n","title":"最小重量値 | ネットワーク | IOTA入門"}}
