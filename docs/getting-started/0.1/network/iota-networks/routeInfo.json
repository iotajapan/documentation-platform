All transactions in a public IOTA network are transparent, and anyone can see them and the balances of all addresses by connecting to a node.\n\nIOTA has the following public networks:\n\n- **Mainnet:** IOTA token\n\n- **Devnet:** Devnet token (free)\n\n## Mainnet\n\nThe Mainnet is the IOTA network that uses the [IOTA tokens](../clients/token.md), which are traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nProduction applications use this network after they have tested IOTA on the [Devnet](#devnet) or a [private Tangle](/docs/compass/0.1/introduction/overview).\n\n:::info:\nCryptocurrency exchanges sell IOTA tokens in units of Mega IOTA (1,000,000), which is also written as MIOTA or Mi.\n:::\n\n![Mainnet configuration](/assets/docs/getting-started/0.1/images/mainnet-configuration.png)\n\n### Minimum weight magnitude\n\nTransactions on the Mainnet must use a [minimum weight magnitude](/docs/getting-started/0.1/transactions/proof-of-work#minimum-weight-magnitude) (MWM) of 14 to be valid.\n\n### Coordinator address\n\nNodes on the Mainnet are all hard-coded with the following address for the [Coordinator](../network/the-coordinator.md):\n\n```\nEQSAUZXULTTYZCLNJNTXQTQHOMOFZERHTCGTXOLTVAHKSA9OGAZDEKECURBRIXIJWNPFCQIOVFVVXJVD9\n```\n\n### Nodes\n\nIt's best practice to run your own node to have direct access to the Tangle, instead of relying on third-party nodes to receive your transactions.\n\nHowever, if you want to test the Mainnet, you can find a list of nodes on community websites such as the following:\n\n- [iota.dance](https://iota.dance/)\n\n- [thetangle.org](https://thetangle.org/nodes)\n\n## Devnet\n\nThe Devnet is similar to the Mainnet, except the tokens are free and it takes less time and computational power to create and send a transaction.\n\nOn this network, you can test your applications and build proofs of concept that use free Devnet tokens.\n\n![Devnet Configuration](/assets/docs/getting-started/0.1/images/devnet-configuration.png)\n\n### Minimum weight magnitude\n\nTransactions on the Devnet must use a [minimum weight magnitude](/docs/getting-started/0.1/transactions/proof-of-work#minimum-weight-magnitude) (MWM) of 9 to be valid.\n\n### Coordinator address\n\nNodes on the Devnet are all hard-coded with the following address for the [Coordinator](../network/the-coordinator.md):\n\n```\nEQQFCZBIHRHWPXKMTOLMYUYPCN9XLMJPYZVFJSAY9FQHCCLWTOLLUGKKMXYFDBOOYFBLBI9WUEILGECYM\n```\n\n### Nodes\n\nThe IOTA Foundation hosts the following nodes that you can use to connect to the Devnet:\n\n#### Load balancer node\n\nThis endpoint gives you access to a high-availability proxy server, which is running a node on the Devnet.\n\nUse the load balancer for sending transactions and requesting information about the ledger from the node.\n\n**URL:** https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443\n\n#### ZMQ node\n\nThis endpoint gives you access to the zero message queue of a node on the Devnet.\n\nUse the ZMQ node to listen for live transaction on the Tangle.\n\n**URL:** tcp://zmq.devnet.iota.org:5556\n\n#### PoW node\n\nThis endpoint gives you access to a node that can do remote proof of work.\n\nUse the PoW node to save power on small devices.\n\n**URL:** https://powbox.devnet.iota.org","title":"IOTAネットワーク | ネットワーク | IOTA入門"}}
