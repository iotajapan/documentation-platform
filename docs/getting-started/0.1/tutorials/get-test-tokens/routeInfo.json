On the Mainnet, these tokens have a monetary value that can be traded on exchanges. To send test [transactions](../transactions/transactions.md), you can use the [Devnet](../network/iota-networks.md), which uses free test tokens.**\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this guide, you need an unspent address.\n\n:::danger:Important\nIf you own IOTA tokens on the Mainnet, we recommend [creating a new seed](../tutorials/create-a-seed.md) to use on the Devnet.\n:::\n\n---\n\nTo get some test tokens, you need to request some from the Devnet faucet website, which distributes tokens in batches of 1 Ki.\n\n1. Go to [the Devnet faucet](https://faucet.devnet.iota.org/)\n\n2. Copy and paste your address into the input field\n\n3. Complete the [reCAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA)\n\n4. Click **Request**\n\n    :::info:\n    The Request button appears only if your address is valid.\n    :::\n\n5. Click **Check balance**\n\nThis link takes you to a Devnet Tangle explorer, which connects to nodes on the Devnet and requests information from them about the bundle that just transferred the free tokens to your address. When the bundle is confirmed, 1 Ki will be added to the balance of your address.\n\n:::info:These tokens are valid only on the Devnet\nYou can use these tokens only when you're connected to a Devnet node. Other IOTA networks have neither received nor validated the bundle that transferred the tokens to your address. As a result, they haven't updated the balance of your address.\n:::\n\n## Next steps\n\nYou can transfer these tokens on the Devnet, using Trinity or one of the client libraries:\n\n- [Transfer your test tokens with Trinity](/docs/wallets/0.1/trinity/how-to-guides/send-a-transaction)\n\n- [Transfer your test tokens with the JavaScript client library](/docs/client-libraries/0.1/how-to-guides/js/transfer-iota-tokens)\n","title":"テストIOTAトークンを入手する | クイックスタート | IOTA入門"}}
