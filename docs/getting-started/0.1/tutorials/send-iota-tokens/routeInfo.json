In this tutorial we send test tokens from one of your addresses to another.**\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you need the following:\n\n* Node.js 8, or Node.js 10 or higher. We recommend the [latest LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n* A code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n* Access to a command prompt\n* An Internet connection\n\n:::info:\n[Get some free test tokens](../tutorials/receive-test-tokens.md)\n:::\n\n## Send test tokens to one of your other addresses\n\nIn this example, we send a bundle to a [Devnet node](../references/iota-networks.md#devnet). The Devnet is similar to the Mainnet, except the tokens are free. Any bundles that you send to the Devnet do not exist on other networks such as the Mainnet.\n\n1. In the command prompt, create a working directory called `iota-example`\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir iota-example\n    ```\n\n2. Change into the `iota-example` directory and install the `core` and `converter` IOTA client libraries\n\n    ```bash\n    cd iota-example\n    npm install @iota/core @iota/converter --save\n    ```\n\n    If everything went well, you should see something like the following in the output. You can ignore any 'npm WARN' messages.\n\n    ```shell\n    + @iota/converter@1.0.0-beta.8\n    + @iota/core@1.0.0-beta.8\n    added 19 packages from 10 contributors and audited 68 packages in 5.307s\n    found 0 vulnerabilities\n    ```\n\n    You now have a `package.json` file and a `node_modules` directory, which contains the IOTA client libraries and their dependencies.\n\n3. In the `iota-example` directory, create a new file called `value-transaction.js`\n\n4. Require the `core` IOTA client library\n\n    ```js\n    // Require the IOTA library\n    const Iota = require('@iota/core');\n    ```\n\n5. Connect to a node\n\n    ```js\n    // Create a new instance of the IOTA API object\n    // Use the `provider` field to specify which IRI node to connect to\n    const iota = Iota.composeAPI({\n    provider: 'https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443'\n    });\n    ```\n\n6. Create a variable to store your seed. Replace this seed with one that owns an address you used to [receive free Devnet tokens](../tutorials/receive-test-tokens.md) \n\n    ```js\n    // Replace this seed with one that owns an address with free Devnet tokens \n    const seed =\n    'PUEOTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX';\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    This seed will be used to prove that you own the address from which you want to withdraw IOTA tokens.\n\n    [Learn how a seed is used to prove ownership of an address](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/addresses-and-signatures).\n    :::\n\n7. Create a new address from your seed to send the tokens to\n\n    ```js\n    const receivingAddress = iota.getNewAddress(seed, {\n        index: 1,\n        total: 1\n    });\n    ```\n\n    :::warning:\n    Be sure that this is not a spent address (one that you have withdrawn from before).\n\n    [Learn why you should never use spent addresses](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/addresses-and-signatures#address-reuse).\n    :::\n\n8. Create a transfer object that specifies the amount of IOTA tokens you want to send, the tag you want to add to the transaction, and the address to send the tokens to\n\n    ```js\n    const transfers = [\n    {\n      value: 500,\n      address: receivingAddress[0],\n      tag: 'MYMAGIC'\n    }\n    ]\n    ```\n\n9. To construct a [bundle](../introduction/what-is-a-bundle.md) from your `transfers` object, pass it to the [`prepareTransfers()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/blob/next/api_reference.md#module_core.prepareTransfers) method. Then, pass the returned bundle trytes to the `sendTrytes()` method to do [tip selection](/docs/the-tangle/0.1/concepts/tip-selection), [proof of work](/docs/the-tangle/0.1/concepts/proof-of-work), and send the bundle to the [node](../introduction/what-is-a-node.md)\n\n    ```js\n    // Construct bundle and convert to trytes\n    const trytes = await iota.prepareTransfers(seed, transfers);\n    // Send bundle to node.\n    const response = await iota.sendTrytes(trytes, 3/*depth*/, 9/*MWM*/);\n    ```\n\n    :::info:Depth\n    The `depth` argument affect tip selection. The greater the depth, the farther back in the Tangle the weighted random walk starts.\n    :::\n    \n    :::info:Minimum weight magnitude (MWM)\n    The [`minimum weight magnitude`](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/minimum-weight-magnitude) (MWM) argument affects the difficulty of proof of work (PoW). The greater the MWM, the more difficult the PoW.\n    \n    Every IOTA network enforces its own MWM. On the Devnet, the MWM is 9. But, on the Mainnet the MWM is 14. If you use a MWM that's too small, your transactions won't be valid and will never be confirmed.\n    :::\n\n:::success:Congratulations :tada:\nYou've just sent your value transaction. Your transaction is attached to [the Tangle](../introduction/what-is-the-tangle.md). Now, you just need to wait until the transaction is confirmed before your balance can be updated.\n:::\n\nIn the console, you'll see information about the transaction in the [bundle](../introduction/what-is-a-bundle.md) that you sent.\n\nThe transactions in your bundle will propagate through the network until all the nodes have it in their ledgers.\n\n## Run the code\n\nClick the green button to run the sample code in this guide and see the results in the web browser.\n\nBefore you run this sample code, replace the seed with your own test seed.\n\n:::danger:Important\nIf you own IOTA tokens on the Mainnet, we recommend creating a new test seed to use on the Devnet.\n\nIf you don't have any test tokens, [request some](../tutorials/receive-test-tokens.md).\n:::\n\n<iframe height=\"600px\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://repl.it/@jake91/Send-IOTA-tokens-on-the-Devnet?lite=true\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n## Next steps\n\n[Check if your transaction is confirmed](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/how-to-guides/check-transaction-confirmation).\n\n","title":"Send test IOTA tokens (Node.js) | Tutorials | Getting Started"}}
