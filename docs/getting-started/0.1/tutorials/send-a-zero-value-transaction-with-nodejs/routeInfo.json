These zero-value transactions are useful for applications that want to send and store immutable messages on the Tangle. To send only a zero-value [transaction](../introduction/what-is-a-transaction.md), you don't need any IOTA tokens.**\n\nTo send any transaction, you must connect to a node, create a bundle, then send that bundle to it.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you need the following:\n\n* Node.js 8, or Node.js 10 or higher. We recommend the [latest LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n* A code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n* Access to a command prompt\n* An Internet connection\n\n## Attach an immutable message to the Tangle\n\nIn this example, we connect to a [Devnet node](../references/iota-networks.md#devnet). The Devnet is similar to the Mainnet, except the tokens are free. Any transactions that you send to the Devnet do not exist on other networks such as the Mainnet.\n\n1. In the command prompt, create a working directory called `iota-example`\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir iota-example\n    ```\n\n2. Change into the `iota-example` directory and install the `core` and `converter` IOTA client libraries\n\n    ```bash\n    cd iota-example\n    npm install @iota/core @iota/converter --save\n    ```\n\n    If everything went well, you should see something like the following in the output. You can ignore any 'npm WARN' messages.\n\n    ```shell\n    + @iota/converter@1.0.0-beta.8\n    + @iota/core@1.0.0-beta.8\n    added 19 packages from 10 contributors and audited 68 packages in 5.307s\n    found 0 vulnerabilities\n    ```\n\n    You now have a `package.json` file and a `node_modules` directory, which contains the IOTA client libraries and their dependencies.\n\n3. In the `iota-example` directory, create a new file called `data-transaction.js`\n\n4. Require the IOTA client libraries\n\n    ```js\n    // Require the IOTA libraries\n    const Iota = require('@iota/core');\n    const Converter = require('@iota/converter');\n    ```\n\n5. Connect to a node\n\n    ```js\n    // Create a new instance of the IOTA object\n    // Use the `provider` field to specify which IRI node to connect to\n    const iota = Iota.composeAPI({\n    provider: 'https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443'\n    });\n    ```\n\n6. Create a variable to store the address to which you want to send a message\n\n    ```js\n    const address =\n    'HELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDD';\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    This address does not have to belong to anyone. To be valid, the address just needs to consist of 81 [trytes](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/trinary).\n    :::\n\n7. Create a variable to store your seed\n\n    ```js\n    const seed =\n    'PUEOTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX';\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    This seed doesn't have to contain any addresses with IOTA tokens. If you enter a seed that consists of less than 81 characters, the library will append 9s to the end of it to make 81 characters.\n    :::\n\n8. Create a message that you want to send to the address and convert it to trytes\n\n    ```js\n    const message = Converter.asciiToTrytes('Hello World!');\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    IOTA networks accept only [tryte-encoded](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/trinary) messages.\n    :::\n\n    :::info:\n    The `asciiToTrytes()` method supports only [basic ASCII characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters). As a result, diacritical marks such as accents and umlauts aren't supported and result in an `INVALID_ASCII_CHARS` error.\n    :::\n\n9. Create a transfer object that specifies the amount of IOTA tokens you want to send, the message that you want to send, and the address to send it to\n\n    ```js\n    const transfers = [\n    {\n        value: 0,\n        address: address,\n        message: message\n    }\n    ];\n    ```\n\n10. To construct a [bundle](../introduction/what-is-a-bundle.md) from your `transfers` object, pass it to the [`prepareTransfers()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/blob/next/api_reference.md#module_core.prepareTransfers) method. Then, pass the returned bundle trytes to the `sendTrytes()` method to do [tip selection](/docs/the-tangle/0.1/concepts/tip-selection), [proof of work](/docs/the-tangle/0.1/concepts/proof-of-work), and send the bundle to the [node](../introduction/what-is-a-node.md)\n\n    ```js\n    iota.prepareTransfers(seed, transfers)\n        .then(trytes => {\n            return iota.sendTrytes(trytes, 3/*depth*/, 9/*minimum weight magnitude*/)\n        })\n        .then(bundle => {\n        console.log(`Bundle: ${JSON.stringify(bundle, null, 1)}`)\n    })\n    .catch(err => {\n            // Catch any errors\n        console.log(err);\n    });\n    ```\n\n    :::info:Depth\n    The `depth` argument affects tip selection. The greater the depth, the farther back in the Tangle the weighted random walk starts.\n    :::\n    \n    :::info:Minimum weight magnitude\n    The [`minimum weight magnitude`](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/minimum-weight-magnitude) (MWM) argument affects the difficulty of proof of work (PoW). The greater the MWM, the more difficult the PoW.\n    \n    Every IOTA network enforces its own MWM. On the Devnet, the MWM is 9. But, on the Mainnet the MWM is 14. If you use a MWM that's too small, your transactions won't be valid and will never be confirmed.\n    :::\n\n:::success:Congratulations :tada:\nYou've just sent your first zero-value transaction.
