IOTA has three [public networks](../references/iota-networks.md) of nodes. Each network has its own unique distributed ledger (the Tangle) that the nodes can append transactions to. You can choose to connect and send bundles to nodes on any public network.**\n\nIOTA has the following [permissionless (public) networks](../introduction/what-is-dlt.md):\n* **Mainnet:** IOTA token\n* **Devnet:** Devnet token (free)\n* **Spamnet:** Spamnet token (free)\n\nAll permissionless networks consist of nodes, clients, and the Coordinator.\n\n:::info:\nIf you want to create and test an application on a permissioned (private) network, you can do so by running an instance of the open-source Coordinator code called [Compass](/docs/compass/0.1/introduction/overview).\n:::\n\n## Mainnet\n\nWhen you buy IOTA tokens from a cryptocurrency exchange, those tokens are valid on the Mainnet.\n\n:::info:\nCryptocurrency exchanges sell IOTA tokens in denominations of Mega IOTA (1,000,000), which is also written as MIOTA or Mi.\n\nLearn more about [units of IOTA tokens](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/references/units-of-iota-tokens).\n:::\n\n![Mainnet configuration](/assets/docs/getting-started/0.1/images/mainnet-configuration.png)\n\n### Minimum weight magnitude\n\nTransactions on the Mainnet must use a [minimum weight magnitude](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/minimum-weight-magnitude) (MWM) of 14 to be valid.\n\n## Devnet\n\nThe Devnet is similar to the Mainnet, except the tokens are free.\n\nOn this network, you can test your applications and build proofs of concept that use free Devnet tokens.\n\n:::info:\n[Receive free Devnet tokens](../tutorials/receive-test-tokens.md)\n:::\n\n![Devnet Configuration](/assets/docs/getting-started/0.1/images/devnet-configuration.png)\n\n### Minimum weight magnitude\n\nTransactions on the Devnet must use a [minimum weight magnitude](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/minimum-weight-magnitude) (MWM) of 9 to be valid.\n\nCompared to the Mainnet, this MWM reduces the time it takes for [proof of work](/docs/the-tangle/0.1/concepts/proof-of-work) (PoW) to be completed. So, it takes less time and computational power to create and send a transaction.\n\n### IRI nodes\n\nWe host the following public IRI nodes on the Devnet:\n\n#### Load balancer node\n\nThis endpoint gives you access to a high-availability proxy server, which is running an IRI node on the Devnet.\n\nUse the load balancer for sending transactions and requesting information about the ledger from the IRI node.\n\n**URL:** https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443\n\n#### ZMQ node\n\nThis endpoint gives you access to the [zero message queue](/docs/iri/0.1/concepts/zero-message-queue) of an IRI node on the Devnet.\n\nUse the ZMQ node to subscribe to events in an IRI node.\n\n**URL:** tcp://zmq.testnet.iota.org:5556\n\n#### PoW node\n\nThis endpoint gives you access to an IRI node that can do remote proof of work.\n\nUse the PoW node to save power on small devices.\n\n**URL:** https://powbox.devnet.iota.org\n\n## Spamnet\n\nThe Spamnet is for applications that send spam transactions.\n\nOn this network, you can test your applications and build proof of concepts that use free Spamnet tokens.\n\n:::info:Receive free Spamnet tokens\nThe [faucet website](https://faucet.spamnet.iota.org) sends 1Ki (1000) Spamnet tokens to your specified address.\n:::\n\n![Spamnet configuration](/assets/docs/getting-started/0.1/images/spamnet-topology.png)\n\n### Minimum weight magnitude\n\nTransactions on the Spamnet must use a [minimum weight magnitude](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/minimum-weight-magnitude) (MWM) of 7 to be valid. Compared to the Mainnet, this MWM reduces the time it takes for [proof of work](/docs/the-tangle/0.1/concepts/proof-of-work) (PoW) to be completed. So, it takes less time and computational power to create and send a transaction.\n\n### IRI nodes\n\nWe host the following public IRI nodes on the Spamnet:\n\n#### Load balancer node\n\nThis endpoint gives you access to a high-availability proxy server, which is running an IRI node on the Spamnet.\n\nUse the load balancer for sending transactions and requesting information about the ledger from the IRI node.\n\n**URL:** https://nodes.spamnet.iota.org:443\n\n#### ZMQ node\n\nThis endpoint gives you access to the [zero message queue](/docs/iri/0.1/concepts/zero-message-queue) of an IRI node on the Spamnet.\n\nUse the ZMQ node to subscribe to events in an IRI node.\n\n**URL:** tcp://zmq.spamnet.iota.org:5556 \n","title":"IOTA networks | References | Getting Started"}}
