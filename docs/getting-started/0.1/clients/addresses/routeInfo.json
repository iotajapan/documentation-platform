Addresses are the public half of a [public/private key pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). To transfer IOTA tokens from one address to another, you sign a transaction with the private key to prove to [nodes](../network/nodes.md) that you own it. As such you can share addresses with anyone because only the seed owner knows the private key.**\n\n## Address format\n\nAn address is a unique string of 81 [trytes](../introduction/ternary.md) (or 90 trytes with a [checksum](../clients/checksums.md)).\n\n```\nOGMMQJUDMNNYSOAXMJWAMNAJPHWMGVAY9UWBXRGTXXVEDIEWSNYRNDQY99NDJQB9QQBPCRRNFAIUPGPLZ\n```\n\n## Maximum number of addresses\n\nA seed can have an almost unlimited number of addresses (9<sup>57</sup>), which each have a unique index and a [security level](../clients/security-levels.md):\n\n* **Index:** Number between 0 and 9,007,199,254,740,991\n* **Security level:** Number between 1 and 3\n\nThe same seed, index, and security level, will always result in the same address.\n\nLikewise, the same seed with a different index and/or a different security level will result in a different address.\n\nFor example, when you generate addresses for index 0 and index 1 of all security levels, they are all unique:\n\n|**Index**|**Security level**|**Address**|\n|:-----|:-----|:-----|\n|0|1|OGMMQJUDMNNYSOAXMJWAMNAJPHWMGVAY9UWBXRGTXXVEDIEWSNYRNDQY99NDJQB9QQBPCRRNFAIUPGPLZ|\n|0|2 |BYNZSDZTNJOUMWLILVKUIWAFTCWTNYCDEI9ZNSRSAMLKURUWYANEGLVHUKWMZQCAMBTDSXKEFVOUYLDSW|\n|0|3|CACHUSACNWAFFIGUAXVBUMZNSAGFPCFXVMYOBQ9IMD9ELZMOYOJAHWPFMOTRJMPISXIF9JEKNDZMQMZEY|\n|1|1|CAZURLTWLREHEPODAQGFEKCVFJMUB9BFGBVWBGRSCWSKYD9UJIARRTPZJH9VUGQIQNJRBKIOATOJCSYJY|\n|1|2|XIUPEDJXBADNCMWAZEGY9HPEASAMLFMIAAXIMLHVRDSADOORPPBFAQDCXGGZQQZLKCERW9J9CKVLASMTZ|\n|1|3|FLXGZSXUJJLQFYYPTKYJRLWOCQSEXTTKVQMGOFPPYYZCLTAIEPKFXDNHHFGNJOASALAD9MJHNCCX9OUVZ|\n\n## Spent addresses\n\nBecause the IOTA protocol uses [one-time signatures](../clients/signatures.md), after IOTA tokens have been withdrawn from an address, it is spent and must never be used again.\n\nIf more IOTA tokens are later deposited into a spent address, they are at risk of being stolen in a [brute-force attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) on the private key.\n\n## How addresses are generated\n\nAll addresses are generated using the [Kerl](https://github.com/iotaledger/kerl) [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), which starts by generating a private key from a seed, an index, and a security level.\n\nFirst, the seed and index are converted to trits, then they're combined and hashed to generate a 243-trit subseed:\n\n```\nKerl(seed + index)\n```\n\nThe subseed is then absorbed and squeezed in a [sponge function](https://keccak.team/sponge_duplex.html) 27 times for each security level.\n\nThe result of the sponge function is a private key whose length varies, depending on the security level.\n\nTo generate an address, the private key is split into 81-tryte segments. Then, each segment is hashed 26 times. \n\n:::info:\nA group of 27 hashed segments is called a key fragment, and a private key has one key fragment for each security level. For example, a private key with security level 1 consists of 2,187 trytes, which is 27 x 81-tryte segments or one key fragment.\n:::\n\nEach key fragment is hashed once to generate one key digest for each security level. Then, the key digests are combined and hashed once to generate an 81-tryte address.\n\n![Address creation](/assets/docs/getting-started/0.1/images/address-generation.png)\n\n## Utilities\n\nYou can use the following IOTA Tangle Utilities with addresses:\n\n* [Convert an address into a QR code](https://utils.iota.org/qr-create)\n\n* [Read an address from a QR code](https://utils.iota.org/qr-scan)\n\n* [Search for transactions that include an address](https://utils.iota.org/)\n\n\n\n","title":"アドレス | クライアント | IOTA入門"}}
