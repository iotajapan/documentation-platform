Checksums are often appended to addresses and seeds in user interfaces to help you to detect typos.**\n\n## Checksum format\n\nThe length of a checksum depends on whether it's for an address or a seed. Address checksums are 9 trytes long, whereas seed checksums are 3 trytes long. The reason for this difference is that mistyping an address can lead to sending IOTA tokens to the wrong address, so the checksum must be more resistant to [collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science)).\n\n||**Without checksum**|**With checksum**|\n|:--|:---|:---|\n|**Seed**|PUEOTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX|PUEOTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX**XTY**|\n|**Address**|GWQQYWCUFLDR9LIWDITVHTPYYO9BAMOADFLNBIHYLIFDTORUCFCOGRQFK9IXEHVEMDVZH9RYOXAFIVUOA|GWQQYWCUFLDR9LIWDITVHTPYYO9BAMOADFLNBIHYLIFDTORUCFCOGRQFK9IXEHVEMDVZH9RYOXAFIVUOA**DAYDSMFZW**| \n\n:::info:\nAs a security precaution, some applications such as [Trinity](/docs/wallets/0.1/trinity/introduction/overview) allow you to enter only addresses that include a checksum.\n:::\n\n## How checksums are generated\n\nFirst, the address or the seed is converted to trits and hashed, using the [Kerl](https://github.com/iotaledger/kerl) [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function).\n\nThen, the last 9 or 3 trytes of the resulting hash are appended to the end of the address or seed.","title":"チェックサム | クライアント | IOTA入門"}}
