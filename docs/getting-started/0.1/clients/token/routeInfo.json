At this point, the nodes in the network were hard-coded with a total supply of 2,779,530,283 277,761.\n\nThis large supply allows each of the billions of devices, which are expected to be a part of the Internet of Things, to have its own wallet and transact micropayments with other devices.\n\n## Value of the IOTA token\n\nThe IOTA token is valuable for the following reasons:\n\n- **It's finite:** The maximum number of IOTA tokens is built into the network and can't ever be changed\n- **It's useful:** To transfer value in an IOTA network, you must use the IOTA token\n\nThe value of the IOTA token is determined by supply and demand on any of the [available markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/#markets).\n\n## Units of IOTA tokens\n\nUnits of IOTA tokens are written in [SI notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix).\n\n| **Unit** | **Name**       | **Amount of IOTA tokens**              |\n| :---- | :---------- | :--------------------- |\n| Pi   | Peta IOTA  | 1,000,000,000,000,000 |\n| Ti   | Terra IOTA | 1,000,000,000,000     |\n| Gi   | Giga IOTA  | 1,000,000,000         |\n| Mi   | Mega IOTA  | 1,000,000             |\n| Ki   | Kila IOTA  | 1,000                 |\n| i    | IOTA       | 1                     |\n\n## Utilities\n\nYou can use a service such as [IOTA Tangle Utilities](https://utils.iota.org/currency-conversion) to find out the exchange rate of IOTA tokens.\n\nYou can also use a Tangle explorer to search for statistics such as the [richest addresses](https://thetangle.org/statistics/richest-addresses).\n\n## Related guides\n\n[Send a transaction in Trinity](/docs/wallets/0.1/trinity/how-to-guides/send-a-transaction).\n\n[Transfer IOTA tokens in JavaScript](/docs/client-libraries/0.1/how-to-guides/js/transfer-iota-tokens).","title":"IOTAトークン | クライアント | IOTA入門"}}
