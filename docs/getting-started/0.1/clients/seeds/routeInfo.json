As a result, the chances of two seeds being the same is very unlikely.\n\n## How seeds are generated\n\nYou are responsible for creating your own seed. If you lose your seed, you can't recover it.\n\nAnyone who has access to a seed is able to sign transactions and therefore has access to any IOTA tokens that belong to the seed's addresses.\n\n## Advice for storing seeds\n\nYou can store your seed in many ways, such as on paper or in a file. But, no storage option is 100% safe, so you should consider the risks and mitigate them as much as possible.\n\n### What should you do?\n\nThis list offers you some advice for storing your seed:\n\n- Make sure that the physical location in which you store your seed is protected from fires, floods, theft, and other physical risks.\n\n- Keep a copy of your seed in a bank vault or safe deposit box\n\n- Use a password manager or virtual vault that is protected by a passphrase and/or a key file\n\n- Use an encrypted disk or NAS to store your seed or password database\n\n### What should you not do?\n\nThis list offers you some ways to avoid losing your seed:\n\n- Do not print your seed with a public printer\n\n- Do not leave your seed on unprotected devices such as USB drives or external hard disks\n\n- Do not store your seed on a public cloud service\n\n- Do not share your seed with anyone\n\n## Utilities\n\nTo simplify the process of securing your seed, sending transactions, and managing your balance, you can use one of the [official open-source wallets](/docs/wallets/0.1/introduction/overview), which are maintained by the IOTA Foundation.\n\n:::warning:\nBe careful where you enter your seed. Some unofficial wallets may not be trustworthy\n:::\n\n\n\n\n","title":"シード | クライアント | IOTA入門"}}
