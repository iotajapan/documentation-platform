As a result, the chances of two seeds being the same is very unlikely.\n\n## How seeds are generated\n\nYou are responsible for creating your own seed. If you lose your seed, you can't recover it.\n\nAnyone who has access to a seed is able to sign transactions and therefore has access to any IOTA tokens that belong to the seed's addresses.\n\n## Utilities\n\nTo simplify the process of securing your seed, sending transactions, and managing your balance, you can use one of the [official open-source wallets](/docs/wallets/0.1/introduction/overview), which are maintained by the IOTA Foundation.\n\n:::warning:\nBe careful where you enter your seed. Some unofficial wallets may not be trustworthy\n:::\n\n## Related guides\n\n[Create a seed](../tutorials/create-a-seed.md).\n\n\n\n\n","title":"シード | クライアント | IOTA入門"}}
