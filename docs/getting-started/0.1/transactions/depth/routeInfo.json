The greater the depth, the farther back in the [Tangle](../network/the-tangle.md) the node starts. A greater depth increases the time that nodes take to complete tip selection, making them use more computational power.**\n\n## Advice for choosing a depth\n\nWhen choosing a depth, you should consider the following question.\n\n### What is the maximum depth that your node will allow?\n\nTo restrict the depth, nodes can define a maximum value for it in the [`MAX-DEPTH`](/docs/node-software/0.1/iri/references/iri-configuration-options#max-depth) configuration option.\n\nIf you aren't connected to your own node, you should consider doing so. This way, you can make sure that you're using a valid depth.\n\nIf you want to use a third-party node, you can check the value of this configuration option by calling the [`getNodeAPIConfiguration`](/docs/node-software/0.1/iri/references/api-reference#getnodeapiconfiguration) endpoint.\n\n## Related guides\n\n[Send a \"hello world\" transaction in JavaScript](/docs/client-libraries/0.1/how-to-guides/js/send-your-first-bundle).\n\n[Transfer IOTA tokens in JavaScript](/docs/client-libraries/0.1/how-to-guides/js/transfer-iota-tokens).\n\n[Send a transaction in Trinity](/docs/wallets/0.1/trinity/how-to-guides/send-a-transaction).","title":"深さ | トランザクション | IOTA入門"}}
