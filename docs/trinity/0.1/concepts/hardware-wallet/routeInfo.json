If you [create a Trinity account with a hardware wallet](https://trinity.iota.org/hardware), you can't send transactions without it.\n\n## Seed creation and seed storage\n\nSeeds are created using a sequence of randomly generated words. After a seed has been created, it will never leave the device, even when you connect it to your computer.\n\nWhen you set up a hardware wallet, it will give you instructions to both write down and never lose your randomly generated words. These words are the key to your device.\n\nIf you ever lose a hardware wallet, you can still access your funds by entering your randomly generated words in another hardware wallet.\n\n## Transaction signing\n\nWhen you send a value transaction, it must contain a valid signature that was created using the correct private key.\n\nBundles are signed on the device. Private keys never leave a hardware wallet, so it's impossible for an attacker to steal your IOTA tokens without it.\n\n## Supported hardware wallets\n\nAt the moment, Trinity supports only the [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s) and the [Ledger Blue](https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-blue).\n\n## Limitations\n\nIf you use a Ledger Nano S with Trinity, you can't withdraw from more than two addresses in the same transaction.\n\nTo check the balances of your addresses, go to **Account management** > **View addresses**.\n\n### Example scenario\n\n* **Address 0:** 200 Mi\n* **Address 1:** 400 Mi\n* **Address 3:** 50 Mi\n\nYou try to send 650 Mi from Trinity, using a Ledger Nano S. This transaction would require a bundle that withdraws from three addresses, so it won't be valid and won't send.\n\n\n","title":"Hardware wallet | Concepts | ウォレット"}}
