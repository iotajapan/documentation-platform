You can add deep links to your website or ecommerce platform to make IOTA payments quicker and easier for customers.**\n\nWhen you click a deep link, Trinity is opened and the parameters of the link are used to auto-populate the transaction fields.\n\nYou can use these parameters to specify the address, amount, and message fields of a transaction.\n\n:::warning:\nBeware of phishing scams. Make sure the link opens the official Trinity wallet.\n:::\n\nAll deep links must start with the `iota://` URI followed by a 90-tryte address (with checksum).\n\nIf you want to specify an amount or message, you can use the following query parameters:\n\n* `amount`\n* `message`\n\nFor example (you can click this link to test it):\n\n<iota://XNGPUCURQLLJFGXNDCMROGYNWAZP9AFWSVEUAIWIESOSPYDUPWSPSREEBWJPD9ZWZPAJKBHPLG99DJWJCZUHWTQTDD/?amount=1000000&message=shirt>\n\n:::info:\nAccounts that are linked to hardware wallets can't send value transactions with a message.\n:::\n\n1. Go to **Settings** > **Advanced settings** and enable deep linking\n\n2. Go back to the home page and click **Receive** to generate a new address\n\n3. Manually create a deep link outside of Trinity, using the new address\n\n4. Embed the deep link on your website or ecommerce platform\n\n    :::info:\n    You currently can't add spaces to the message in deep links.\n    :::\n\nTo test your deep link, copy and paste the link into a browser's address bar. Trinity will open and you will see the auto-populated transaction fields.","title":"Create a deep link | How-to Guides | Trinity Wallet"}}
