This view can cause Trinity to display an incorrect balance.\n\nTo fix this problem, Trinity keeps a list of generated addresses so it can be manually re-synchronized.\n\nIf you think your balance is wrong (and a [global snapshot](../how-to-guides/perform-a-snapshot-transition.md) hasn't occurred), you can manually synchronize it by going to **Settings** > **Account** > **Account management** > **Tools** > **Sync account**.\n\n![Manual update](/assets/docs/trinity/0.1/images/sync.jpg) \n\n## Pending transaction\n\nWhen you send a transaction, it has a pending status until it's confirmed.\n\nIf a transaction is pending for a long time, make sure that the [Auto-promotion setting](../how-to-guides/change-the-advanced-settings.md) is set to **Enabled**.\n\n:::info:\nAuto-promotion is available on mobile devices only when Trinity is in the foreground.\n:::\n\n## Unable to send a transaction\n\nTrinity may stop you from sending a transaction for any of the following reasons:\n\n* For security reasons IOTA addresses should be withdrawn from only once. If you have funds on an address that has already been withdrawn from, Trinity stops you withdrawing from that address to protect your funds.\n* If the address you are sending to has been withdrawn from before, Trinity will prevent you sending to that address to protect the funds. In this case, ask your recipient for a new address.\n* If you are making multiple transactions, you may need to wait for your first transaction to be confirmed before making another transaction\n  \nPlease get in touch with us on the #help channel in the official IOTA Discord for further help.\n\n## Lost access to a device\n\nDon’t worry, nobody can access your seed or balance without your password. You can access your funds by installing Trinity on another device and entering your seed backup during the setup.\n\n:::info:\nFor extra protection in the case of a lost device, please create a new seed and transfer your funds to an address from that seed.\n:::\n","title":"Troubleshooting | References | トリニティ"}}
