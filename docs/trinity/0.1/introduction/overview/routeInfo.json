Therefore, to ensure the security of your funds, Trinity has been audited multiple times by external parties.\n\nIf you find a vulnerability and you report it to us, you'll receive a monetary reward through our [bug bounty](https://bugcrowd.com/iota). For more information, see [Trinity Bug Bounty](https://blog.iota.org/trinity-public-bug-bounty-df9d2512e50).\n\n## Limitations\n\nTrinity is a platform on which developers can build their own features. Although you can't use Trinity to buy IOTA tokens from an exchange for example, this feature could be developed by an interested third party.\n\nTrinity mobile does not support background processes. If you navigate to another app while an action (for example, logging in, sending transactions, and refreshing your balance) is ongoing, that action **won't** be completed.\n\n","title":"Overview | Introduction | トリニティ"}}
