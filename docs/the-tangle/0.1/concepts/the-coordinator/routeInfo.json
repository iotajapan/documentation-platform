These bundles contain transactions called milestones that nodes use to reach a consensus. When milestones directly or indirectly reference and approve a transaction in the Tangle, nodes mark the state of that transaction and its entire history as confirmed.**\n\n## Milestones\n\nThe Coordinator sends milestones to nodes at regular intervals. Nodes use these milestones to reach a consensus. \n\nTo determine which transactions are milestones, all nodes in the same IOTA network know the address of the Coordinator.\n\nWhen nodes see a transaction that's been sent from the Coordinator's address, they validate it by doing the following:\n\n* Make sure that it doesn't lead to a double-spend\n* Verify its signature\n\nBecause IOTA uses the Winternitz one-time signature scheme (W-OTS), a private key should sign only one bundle. To allow the Coordinator to sign multiple bundles whose signatures can still be verified against one address, that address is derived from the Coordinator's Merkle tree.\n\n### The Coordinator's Merkle tree\n\nA Merkle tree is a data structure that starts by hashing data at the leaves and ends at the Merkle root (the Coordinator's address).\n\n![Example Merkle tree](/assets/docs/the-tangle/0.1/images/merkle-tree-example.png)\n\nThe Coordinator can sign and send one signed bundle for each leaf in its Merkle tree.\n\nIn this example, we have four leaves, which each represent one of the Coordinator's public/private key pairs. These key pairs are created in advance and used to calculate the the Coordinator's address. The total number of key pairs in a Merkle tree depends on its depth in this formula: 2<sup>depth</sup>. In this example, the Merkle tree's depth is 2.\n\n:::info:\nOn the Mainnet, the Coordinator's Merkle tree has a depth of 23. So, the Coordinator has 8,388,608 public/private key pairs and can send the same number of milestones.\n:::\n\nTo calculate the Coordinator's address, the public keys are hashed in pairs:\n\n* **Node 1:** Hash(Hash(public key of leaf 1) Hash(public key of leaf 2))\n* **Node 2:** Hash(Hash(public key of leaf 3) Hash(public key of leaf 4))\n* **Coordinator's address:** Hash(Hash(node 1) Hash(node 2))\n\nNode 1 is a hash of the result of hashing both the public key of leaf 1 and the public key of leaf 2. Node 2 is a hash of the result of hashing both the public key of leaf 3 and the public key of leaf 4. The Coordinator's address is a hash of the result of hashing the hash of node 1 and node 2.\n\n:::info:\nThe Coordinator's private keys are derived from a seed, an index, and a security level.\n\nOn the Mainnet, these private keys are security level 2. As a result, the milestone signature is too large to fit in one transaction and must be fragmented across two.\n\n[Learn more about how private keys are derived](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/addresses-and-signatures).\n:::\n\n### How nodes verify a milestone\n\nTo verify a milestone, nodes must rebuild the Merkle tree to find the Merkle root. If the rebuilt Merkle root is the same as the Coordinator's address, nodes know the milestone was sent by the Coordinator.\n\nTo allow nodes to rebuild the Merkle tree, the Coordinator sends the following milestone transactions in the bundle:\n\n* Two transactions that contain the fragmented signature\n* One transaction whose [`signatureMessageFragment`](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/references/structure-of-a-transaction) field contains enough missing data from the Merkle tree to be able to rebuild it\n\n![Example Merkle tree](/assets/docs/the-tangle/0.1/images/merkle-tree-example.png)\n\nFor example, as a node, we have seen a bundle that was signed with the private key of leaf 1.\n\nFirst, we verify the signature to find out the public key of leaf 1.\n\n:::info:\n[Learn how nodes verify signatures](/docs/iota-basics/0.1/concepts/addresses-and-signatures#how-nodes-verify-signatures)\n:::\n\nTo help us calculate the Merkle root, the third milestone in the bundle contains the following:\n\n* The public key of leaf 2\n* The hash of node 2\n\nNow, we hash the public keys of leaves 1 and 2 to find the hash of node 1. Then we hash the hash of nodes 1 and 2 to find the Merkle root.\n\nIf the Merkle root is the same as the Coordinator's address, the bundle was signed with one of the private keys in the Coordinator's Merkle tree.\n\n:::info:Want to run your own Coordinator?\nUse Compass to create, sign, and send milestones in your own IOTA network.\n:::","title":"The Coordinator | Concepts | The Tangle"}}
