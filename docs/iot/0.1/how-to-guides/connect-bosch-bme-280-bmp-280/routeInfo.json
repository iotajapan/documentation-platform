In this guide, you connect a Bosch BME/BMP 280 sensor board to your microcontroller.**\n\n**BME 280 I2C board**\n![BME 280 I2C board](/assets/docs/iot/0.1/images/BME280_board.png)\n\n1. Solder the pin headers to the board\n\n2. [Connect the sensor to your microcontroller](../how-to-guides/connect-a-I2C-sensor.md)\n\n3. Connect the SDO pin to the VDDIO pin to give the BME/BMP 280 the [I2C device address 0x77.](https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BMP280-DS001.pdf) (See \"5.2 I²C Interface\" for more information.)\n\n4. If you have a BME/BMP 280 sensor without the board, you need to do the following to select the I2C interface:\n- [Pull up the SCL and SDA lines](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/1852/201179)\n- [Connect the CSB pin to the VDDIO pin](https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BMP280-DS001.pdf)\n (see \"5.1 Interface selection\" for more information)\n\n","title":"Connect a Bosch sensor | How-to Guides | IoTプロジェクト"}}
