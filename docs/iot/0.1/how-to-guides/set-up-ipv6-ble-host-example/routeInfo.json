This is useful for applications that need to access this data and perform calculations on it.**\n\n:::info:\nDue to a bug in RIOT OS, the nRF52832 is the only supported microcontroller at the moment. An implementation for state-of-the-art hardware such as the nRF52840 is in progress.\n:::\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Set up an nRF52832 microcontroller](../how-to-guides/set-up-nrf52-microcontroller.md)\n- [Connect a BME/BMP 280 sensor to the microcontroller](../how-to-guides/connect-bosch-bme-280-bmp-280.md)\n- Linux-based PC that's connected to your microcontroller\n\n## Start the server\n\n1. Change into the `BLE-environment-sensor/examples/env_sensor_network` directory\n\n    ```bash\n    cd BLE-environment-sensor/examples/env_sensor_network/\n    ```\n    \n2. Flash the example onto the microcontroller. Replace the `$BOARD` AND `$USB_PORT` placeholders with the name of your board AND the path to your USB-to-UART connector such as `/dev/ttyUSB0` \n    \n    ```bash\n    BOARD=BOARD PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 make flash term\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    See the RIOT documentation to [find the name of your board](https://api.riot-os.org/group__boards.html).\n    :::\n\n    :::info:\n    This is an example application. You can edit the `BLE-environment-sensor/examples/env_sensor_network/server.c` and `BLE-environment-sensor/examples/env_sensor_network/sensor.c` files to support different sensors to the BME/BMP 280.\n    :::\n\nIf everything went well, you should see no errors, and if you do `help`, you should see a list of available commands.\n`server` must be one of the available options.\n\nTo see a list of all running processes, do `ps`.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you see the following error, install python-protobuf for your Linux distribution:\n\n```bash\n*************************************************************\n*** Could not import the Google protobuf Python libraries ***\n*** Try installing package 'python-protobuf' or similar.  ***\n*************************************************************\n```\n\nFor example, for Ubuntu, do the following:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install python-protobuf\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\nIf you haven't already set up a border router, [do it now](../how-to-guides/set-up-a-ble-ipv6-border-router.md).\n\nIf you've already set up a border router, then you have a complete Bluetooth star network, and you're ready to try one of our sample applications:\n\n* [Request data from the sensor server](../how-to-guides/run-an-environment-sensor-and-client.md)\n* [Attach sensor data to the Tangle](../how-to-guides/run-an-environment-to-tangle-app.md)\n","title":"Set up a sensor server | How-to Guides | IoTプロジェクト"}}
