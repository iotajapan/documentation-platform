Configure the sensor drivers\n\nTo be able to read data from a sensor, you need to configure the code so that the sensor's drivers are compiled onto the microcontroller.\n\n1. Change into the `BLE-environment-sensor/examples/saul` directory\n\n    ```bash\n    cd BLE-environment-sensor/examples/saul\n    ```\n\n2. In the `Makefile` file, add `USEMODULE += bmx280` under `USEMODULE += ps` so that the driver for the BME/BMP 280 sensor can be compiled into your application\n\n    :::info:\n    All driver module names for the pattern `USEMODULE += DRIVER_NAME` are in the `drivers` directory.\n    :::\n\n## Step 2. Compile and flash the application\n\nAfter configuring the code to use the correct sensor drivers, you can compile it and flash it onto your microcontroller.\n    \n1. Compile and flash the operating system and the application. Replace the `$BOARD` AND `$USB_PORT` placeholders with the name of your board and the path to your USB-to-UART connector such as `/dev/ttyUSB0`.\n    \n    ```bash\n    BOARD=BOARD PORT=USB_PORT make flash term\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    See the RIOT documentation to [find the name of your board](https://api.riot-os.org/group__boards.html).\n    :::\n\n2. Use the RIOT OS [hardware abstraction layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_abstraction) ([SAUL](https://riot-os.org/api/group__drivers__saul.html)) to find a list of all available sensors\n\n    :::info:\n    You can also access the sensor by its [SAUL device class](https://riot-os.org/api/group__drivers__saul.html#ga425be5f49e9c31d8d13d53190a3e7bc2)\n    :::\n    \n    ```bash\n    saul\n    ```\n    \n    You should see a list of all available sensors. For example:\n\n    ```bash\n    2019-09-02 16:54:12,881 - INFO #  saul\n    2019-09-02 16:54:12,883 - INFO # ID     Class           Name\n    2019-09-02 16:54:12,887 - INFO # #0     ACT_SWITCH      Led Red\n    2019-09-02 16:54:12,888 - INFO # #1     ACT_SWITCH      Led Green\n    2019-09-02 16:54:12,891 - INFO # #2     ACT_SWITCH      Led Blue\n    2019-09-02 16:54:12,893 - INFO # #3     SENSE_TEMP      NRF_TEMP\n    2019-09-02 16:54:12,894 - INFO # #4     SENSE_TEMP      bme280\n    2019-09-02 16:54:12,896 - INFO # #5     SENSE_PRESS     bme280\n    2019-09-02 16:54:12,897 - INFO # #6     SENSE_HUM       bme280\n    ```\n    \n3. To read the data from a particular sensor, execute the `saul read` command followed by an ID. To read the data from all sensors, execute the `saul read all` command.\n\n    ```bash\n    saul read 5\n    ```\n\n    You should see something like the following:\n    \n    ```\n    2019-09-02 16:54:30,904 - INFO #  saul read 5\n    2019-09-02 16:54:30,907 - INFO # Reading from #5 (bme280|SENSE_PRESS)\n    2019-09-02 16:54:30,909 - INFO # Data:         1631 hPa\n    ```\n\n## Next steps\n\nReading sensor data from a shell session like this is useful only while you debug an application.\n\nFor a production application, you can [set up a sensor server](../how-to-guides/run-an-environment-sensor-and-client.md) that allows clients to connect to it and read its data. \n","title":"Read sensor data from a microcontroller | How-to Guides | IoTプロジェクト"}}
