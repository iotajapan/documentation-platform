For example, if the client (the SBC or the PC) sends a UDP packet on port 90 (outgoing-port at the SBC) to port 51037 (incoming-port on the sensor), the sensor sends the response to port 90 (on the SBC or PC).\n\n## Run the sensor server and client\n\n1. Start the server on your microcontroller\n    \n    :::info:\n    You need to execute the following command in the serial console of your microcontroller.\n\n    The serial terminal of your microcontroller is opened in the terminal where you executed the `make flash term` command.\n    :::\n    \n    ```bash\n    server start\n    ```\n    \n2. Clone the client onto your SBC or PC\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/iota-community/BLE-environment-sensor-client.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/citrullin/udp_client\n    ```\n\n3. In the `client.go` file, replace the `\"fe80::2ca:46ff:fed3:1967\"` IPv6 address with the IPv6 address of your sensor server to allow the client to connect to it\n\n    ```c\n    var seedSensorConfig = SensorNode{\n        Config: SensorConfig{\n            Address: net.UDPAddr{\n                IP: net.ParseIP(\"fe80::2ca:46ff:fed3:1967\"), Port: 51037, Zone: interfaceName,\n            },\n        },\n    }\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    To find out the IPv6 address of your sensor server, execute the `ifconfig` command in the serial interface of the microcontroller.\n    :::\n    \n4. Run the client application\n\n    ```bash\n    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/citrullin/udp_client && go run client.go\n    ```\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow, you're ready to [attach this sensor data to the Tangle](../how-to-guides/run-an-environment-to-tangle-app.md).","title":"Run a sensor server and client | How-to Guides | IoTプロジェクト"}}
