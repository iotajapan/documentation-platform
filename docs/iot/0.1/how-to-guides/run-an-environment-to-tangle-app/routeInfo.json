Start the server on your microcontroller\n    \n    :::info:\n    You need to execute the following command in the serial console of your microcontroller.\n    The serial console of your microcontroller is opened in the terminal where you executed `make flash term`.\n    :::\n    \n    ```bash\n    server start\n    ```\n    \n2. Clone the environment sensor client and MAM writer onto your SBC\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/iota-community/env-sensor-mam-writer.git\n    ```\n\n3. Change the configuration variables in the `app/server-client.c` file\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo nano env-sensor-mam-writer/app/server-client.c\n    ```\n\n    |**Variable**|**Description**|**Notes**|\n    |:-------|:----------|:----|\n    |`IOTA_SEED`| The seed that you want to use to sign MAM messages|You should change this default seed to your own, which does not contain any addresses that contain IOTA tokens|\n    |`CLIENT_ADDRESS`| The IPv6 client address as a hex array|For example, the`fe80::f2d5:bfff:fe10:f1b1` address becomes `{ 0xfe, 0x80, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xf2, 0xd5, 0xbf, 0xff, 0xfe, 0x10, 0xf1, 0xb1 }`. The university of Iowa has a [good explanation how the IPv6 addressing works](https://its.uiowa.edu/support/article/1209).|\n    |`SENSOR_ADDRESS`|The IPv6 address of the sensor node|Execute the command `ifconfig` in the shell of your sensor node to find this address|\n\n4. Run the MAM writer application\n\n    ```bash\n    cd env-sensor-mam-writer &&  bazel run -c opt //app\n    ```\n\n    The application requests the environment data from the sensor, then publishes that data to a MAM channel.\n\n    Make a note of both the address and the bundle hash that are logged to the console so that you can use them in step 6.\n\n5. Open a new terminal window, and clone the MAM reader application onto your SBC\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/iota-community/env-sensor-mam-reader.git\n    ```\n\n6. Change the configuration variables in the `app/sensor_receiver.c` file\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo nano env-sensor-mam-reader/app/sensor_receiver.c\n    ```\n\n    |**Variable**|**Description**|\n    |:-------|:----------|\n    |`IOTA_ADDRESS`|The address that was returned by the writer application|\n    |`IOTA_BUNDLE`|The bundle hash that was returned by the writer application|\n\n7. Run the MAM reader application\n\n    ```bash\n    cd env-sensor-mam-reader && bazel run -c opt //app\n    ```\n\nThe application displays the temperature data it read from the MAM channel on the Tangle.\n","title":"Attach sensor data to the Tangle | How-to Guides | IoTプロジェクト"}}
