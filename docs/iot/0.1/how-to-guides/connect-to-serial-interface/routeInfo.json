To access the serial port on the microcontroller, you need a USB-to-UART connector (sometimes called a USB to TTL serial connector) that can plug into the USB port of your PC. Some microcontroller development boards include an integrated USB-to-UART connector, but others do not. In this case, you need to connect an external USB-to-UART connector to your microcontroller, then plug it into your PC to be able to communicate with the microcontroller.**\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this guide, you need the following:\n\n- A USB-to-UART connector\n- DuPont cables to connect the USB-to-UART connector to your microcontroller\n\n## Connect to the USB-to-UART adapter\n\n1. Connect the UART-to-USB dongle to your microcontroller on pins P0.6 and P0.8\n    \n    |    **nRF52 (pin)**   |    **USB-to-UART**  |\n    |------------------|------------------|\n    |    TX (P0.6)     |    RX            |\n    |    RX (P0.8)     |    TX            |\n    |    VCC           |    VCC           |\n    |    GND           |    GND           |\n\n    **USB-to-UART**\n\n    ![USB-to-UART pinout](/assets/docs/iot/0.1/images/usb-to-uart.png)\n\n    :::info:\n    Use a black cable for GND and a red one for VCC\n    :::\n\n2. Plug the UART-to-USB dongle into your PC\n\nThe microcontroller's pinout depends on the development board you use. In this guide, we use an nRF52832 module and an nrf52832 minimum test board.\n    \n:::info:\nThis breakout board is also compatible with the nRF51822 and nRF52832. If you are going to use the breakout board, make sure your microcontroller has 1.27mm pitch.\n:::","title":"シリアルインターフェイスに接続する | ハウツーガイド | IoTプロジェクト"}}
