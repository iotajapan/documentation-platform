If you have one of these boards, you don't need an additional programmer and/or USB-to-UART connector.\n\nTo find out if your board has an integrated programmer and/or USB-to-UART connector, see its datasheet.\n:::\n\n## Step 1. Set up the hardware for your microcontroller\n    \n1. If the pins on your microcontroller aren't soldered onto the board, solder them.\n    \n    :::info:\n    This is a [useful soldering guide](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/the-ultimate-guide-to-soldering).\n    :::\n    \n2. If your microcontroller doesn't have an integrated programmer, [connect your external one to it](../how-to-guides/connect-programmer.md)\n\n3. If your microcontroller doesn't have an integrated USB-to-UART connector, [connect your external one to it](../how-to-guides/connect-to-serial-interface.md)\n\n## Step 2. Set up the software on your PC\n\nTo program and flash a microcontroller, you need a Linux-based PC that has the necessary tools (known as a toolchain).\n\n1. [Install Git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git)\n\n2. [Install the ARM toolchain](../how-to-guides/install-arm-gcc-toolchain.md), which allows you to compile code into binary that your microcontroller can run\n\n3. [Install OpenOCD](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/OpenOCD), which includes scripts to make it easy to flash the binary onto your microcontroller\n\n4. Install Python 3 and the `pip` installer\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo apt-get install -y python3-all\n    sudo apt-get install -y python-pip3\n    ```\n\n5. If your Linux distribution has Python 2 pre-installed, make sure that it uses Python 3 by default\n\n    ```bash\n    echo \"alias python=python3\" >> ~/.bashrc\n    ```\n\n6. Install one of these programmer toolchains, depending on the programmer that you're using\n \n   **Option 1:** [Install the J-Link or J-Link OB toolchain](https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/debug/jlink/install/)\n    \n   **Option 2:** [Install the DAPLink toolchain](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD#installing). Make sure that you install this toolchain, using the `pip3` command.\n\n7. Clone our forked RIOT OS repository and change into the `BLE-environment-sensor/examples/hello-world` directory\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/iota-community/BLE-environment-sensor.git\n    cd BLE-environment-sensor/examples/hello-world\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    RIOT OS is a modular [microkernel operating system](https://wiki.osdev.org/Microkernel).\n    The modularity helps keep the operating system as small as possible by allowing you to compile only the modules that are essential for your application. This feature is beneficial for microcontrollers because they often have a small amount of available memory space.\n    :::\n\n8. Find the path to your USB-to-UART connector by removing it, executing the `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` command, plugging the USB-to-UART connector back into your PC, then executing the `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` command again. The new entry is your connector.\n\n9. Change the permissions for your USB-to-UART connector. Replace the `$USB_PORT` placeholder with the path to your USB-to-UART connector such as `/dev/ttyUSB0`.\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo chmod 777 $USB_PORT\n    ```\n\n10. Flash the 'hello world' example onto your microcontroller. Replace the `$BOARD` AND `$USB_PORT` placeholders with the name of your board and the path to your USB-to-UART connector such as `/dev/ttyUSB0`\n\n    :::info:\n    To [find the name of your board](https://api.riot-os.org/group__boards.html), see the RIOT documentation.\n    :::\n\n    ```bash\n    BOARD=BOARD PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 make flash term\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    If you see  a `permission denied` or `arm-none-eabi-gcc version not supported` message, [see our troubleshooting guide](../references/troubleshooting.md).\n    :::\n\n    You should see something like the following in the shell:\n\n    ```\n    2019-08-27 09:17:09,359 - INFO # main(): This is RIOT! (Version: 2019.10-devel-488-g1b1c9)\n    2019-08-27 09:17:09,359 - INFO # Hello World!\n    2019-08-27 09:17:09,361 - INFO # You are running RIOT on a(n) nrf52832-mdk board.\n    ```\n\n:::success: Congratulations :tada:\nNow that you can compile code and flash it to your microcontroller, you're ready to build some real applications.\n:::\n\n## Next steps\n\nFollow one of the our microcontroller guides:\n\n- [Read data from a sensor on your microcontroller](../how-to-guides/read-sensor-data.md)\n- [Run an environment sensor server and client](../how-to-guides/run-an-environment-sensor-and-client.md)\n- [Attach sensor data to the Tangle](../how-to-guides/run-an-environment-to-tangle-app.md)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n    ","title":"Set up an nRF52 microcontroller | How-to Guides | IoTプロジェクト"}}
