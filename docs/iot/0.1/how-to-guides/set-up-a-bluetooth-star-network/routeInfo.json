In this guide, you set up a a [6LoWPAN](../concepts/ipv6-mesh-network.md) Bluetooth star network, using state-of-the-art IoT industry standards.**\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Configure a Linux-based PC as a border router](../how-to-guides/set-up-a-ble-ipv6-border-router.md)\n- [Configure and flash the microcontroller to use as a sensor server node](../how-to-guides/set-up-ipv6-ble-host-example.md)\n\n---\n\n1. Scan for BLE devices on your border router\n\n    ```bash\n    hcitool lescan\n    ```\n\n    You can also verify the address by executing the following command in the serial console of your microcontroller\n\n    ```bash\n    ifconfig\n    ```\n    \n    The Long HWaddr is the Bluetooth MAC address. It must be the same as the MAC address that was returned by the `hcitool` scan.\n\n2. Connect your sensor server to your border router. Replace the `00:AA:BB:XX:YY:ZZ` placeholder with the address of your sensor server\n\n    :::info:\n    You can connect multiple sensor servers to your border router by adding other addresses.\n    :::\n    \n    ```bash\n    echo \"connect 00:AA:BB:XX:YY:ZZ 1\" >> /sys/kernel/debug/bluetooth/6lowpan_control\n    ```\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that you have a Bluetooth star network, you're ready to try one of our sample applications:\n\n* [Request data from the sensor server](../how-to-guides/run-an-environment-sensor-and-client.md)\n* [Attach sensor data to the Tangle](../how-to-guides/run-an-environment-to-tangle-app.md)","title":"Bluetoothスターネットワークをセットアップする | ハウツーガイド | IoTプロジェクト"}}
