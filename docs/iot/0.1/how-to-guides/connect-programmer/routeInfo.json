Some microcontrollers don't have an integrated programmer, in which case, you need to connect an external one.**\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this guide, you need the following:\n\n- Linux-based PC to which to connect the programmer\n- A programmer (J-Link, J-Link OB clone, or DAPLink)\n- An nRF52 series microcontroller\n\n:::info:\nIf you want a cheap option for flashing an nRF52 series microcontroller, consider buying a J-Link on-board (OB) clone.\n\nThe standard J-link programmers are more expensive because they can also be used on microprocessors.\n:::\n\n---\n\n1.

So, you need only to connect the microcontroller board to your PC with the correct USB cable.\n    \n2.
