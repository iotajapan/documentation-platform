In this guide, you connect a Bosch BME/BMP 280 sensor board to your microcontroller so that they can communicate with each other.**\n\n## Hardware\n\nTo complete this guide, you need the following:\n\n- [An nRF52-series microcontroller](../introduction/get-started.md)\n- A Bosch BME/BMP 280 sensor\n\n---\n\n1. If the pin headers aren't already soldered onto the sensor, solder them on\n\n2. Connect the sensor's SDA and SCL pins to the microcontroller\n\n    | **nRF52** | **Sensor** |\n    |-----------------|------------|\n    |      P0.26      |     SDA    |\n    |      P0.27      |     SCL    |\n\n    :::info:\n    The nRF52 has a feature called [EasyDMA](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.nrf52832.ps.v1.1%2Feasydma.html&cp=3_1_0_9&anchor=easydma), which allows you to [assign wire protocols to any pin](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.nrf52832.ps.v1.1%2Ftwim.html&cp=3_1_0_32&anchor=concept_scx_f5p_xr).\n    :::\n\n3. Connect the SDO pin to the VDDIO pin to give the sensor the I2C device address 0x77\n\n4. If you have a BME/BMP 280 sensor without the board, select the I2C interface by doing the following:\n\n- [Pull up the SCL and SDA lines](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/1852/201179)\n- Connect the CSB pin to the VDDIO pin\n\n5. If you want to connect more than one sensor to your microcontroller, you need to make sure that each one has a unique 7-bit address. Generally, sensors have a PIN that you need to pull up or down to select the I2C address. See your sensor's datasheet for information about how to do this:\n\n- [BMP 280 datasheet](https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BMP280-DS001.pdf)\n- [BME 280 datasheet](https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BME280-DS002.pdf)\n\n## Next steps\n\n[Read the data from your sensor](../how-to-guides/read-sensor-data.md).\n\nIf you want to use a different I2C sensor, check the [RIOT OS sensor driver list](http://riot-os.org/api/group__drivers__sensors.html) to make sure that it is supported by the RIOT OS operating system, which we use in these guides.\n","title":"マイクロコントローラーにセンサーを接続する | セットアップガイド | nRF52 | IoT プロジェクト"}}
