Some microcontroller development boards include an integrated USB-to-UART connector, but others do not. In this guide, you connect an external USB-to-UART connector to your microcontroller and plug it into your PC to be able to communicate with the microcontroller.**\n\n## Hardware\n\nTo complete this guide, you need DuPont cables to connect the USB-to-UART connector to your microcontroller\n\n## Step 1. Choose a USB-to-UART connector\n\nMany USB-to-UART connectors are available, and you may find that they are named differently, depending on the vendor. For example, you may see USB-to-TTL and USB-to-serial connectors.\n\nWhichever connector you choose, make sure that it has a [device driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver) that's compatible with your operating system.\n\n## Step 2. Wire the connector to your microcontroller\n\nTo use your connector, you need to wire it to your microcontroller.\n\n1. Connect the following pins from the nRF52 to the connector\n\n    |    **nRF52 (pin)**   |    **USB-to-UART**  |\n    |------------------|------------------|\n    |    TX (P0.6)     |    RX            |\n    |    RX (P0.8)     |    TX            |\n    |    VCC           |    VCC           |\n    |    GND           |    GND           |\n\n    **USB-to-UART**\n\n    :::info:\n    Use a black DuPont cable for GND and a red one for VCC\n    :::\n\n2. Plug the UART-to-USB dongle into your PC\n\nIf the connections are correct, your PC should detect the connector.\n\n## Next steps\n\n[Continue setting up your microcontroller](../introduction/get-started.md#step-2-set-up-your-development-environment).\n","title":"マイクロコントローラーにシリアルインターフェースを接続する | セットアップガイド | nRF52 | IoT プロジェクト"}}
