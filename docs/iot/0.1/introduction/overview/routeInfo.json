Thanks to this data-sharing network, IoT is becoming the driving force in creating more efficient communication across many aspects of our lives. IOTA allows these devices to use the Tangle as a single source of truth, where they can buy, sell, or simply send data among each other for zero fees.**\n\nIn this series of articles, we start from the basics to show you how to set up small devices such as microcontrollers on the Internet of Things. Then, as you become more confident, we connect these devices to the Tangle, so that you can attach immutable sensor data to it for other devices to read or even buy.\n\n## Supported boards\n\n---------------\n#### **nRF52** ####\n[nRF52](../nrf52/introduction/get-started.md)\n\nThe nRF52 is power-efficient series of microcontrollers that supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), allowing you to build low-power wireless solutions.\n---\n#### **ESP32** ####\n[ESP32](../esp32/introduction/get-started.md)\n\nThe ESP32 is a WiFi-compatible microcontroller that also support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).\n---\n#### __Single-board computers__ ####\n[SBC](../sbc/introduction/get-started.md)\n\nSingle-board computers (SBCS) are useful for building applications that require more power than a microcontroller. SBCs are lighter, smaller, and more power efficient than multi-board computers such as desktops.\n---------------\n","title":"概要 | 序説 | IoT プロジェクト"}}
