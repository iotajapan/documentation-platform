In the star topology,all devices directly communicate with the border router, which acts as a switch to pass on their messages.\n\n|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|\n|:---------|:------------|\n|A single device failure does not affect the entire network|More cables are required because each computer connects to the border router|\n|Easy to extend|The border router is a single point of failure|\n|Fast data transfer|\n\n![Star network topology](/assets/docs/iot/0.1/images/star_topology.png)\n\n### Mesh tree\n\nA mesh tree topology is a network topology in which all the network nodes are connected to most of the other nodes. In this topology, no switch acts as a central point of communication to pass on the messages. Instead, messages are routed through the network.\n\n|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|\n|:---------|:------------|\n|Easy to diagnose a faulty device|Can be difficult to add more devices to the network|\n|Secure and private connections|\n\n![Mesh tree network topology](/assets/docs/iot/0.1/images/mesh.png)\n\n## Naming convention\n\nThe following naming conventions are used to describe 6LoWPAN mesh networks.\n\n### LLN\n\nLLN stands for low power and lossy networks. \nIt describes a type of network where some devices might be not be available all the time. \nFor example when a device only wakes up in a certain interval.\nIt also describes a network where a packet might get lost, due to unreliable devices.\nThe range of the radio can also play a role in it. \n\n### Host\n\nHost describes a device which is not a router. In a mesh tree the host is a leaf node.\n\n### Node\n\nNode refers to any device in the network structure. This can either be a host or a router.\n\n### IEEE 802.15.4\n\n[IEEE 802.15.4](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4-2015.html) is the PHY and MAC layer for the 6LoWPAN network. \n\nThe Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum modulation used in IEEE 802.15.4 \ninterferes less with other protocol on the same frequency. \n\n### 6LoWPAN\n\n6LoWPAN is a system that combines the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IPv6) and Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPAN). 6LoWPAN, allows small devices with limited processing ability to transmit information wirelessly using an internet protocol for a variety of applications including wireless sensor networks.\n\nIt uses header compression to reduce the size of local IPv6 addresses to conform to the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, which allows for a packet size of up to 127 bytes.\n\nThe 6LoWPAN layer uses transparent packet fragmentation to combine the IEEE 802.15.4 packets.\n\nThe standard is defined in the following documents:\n[RFC 8025](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8025/), \n[RFC 6775](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6775/), \n[RFC 6282](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6282/), \n[RFC 8066](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8066/) \n\n### IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy\n\nThe IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy protocol uses 6LoWPAN techniques to enable IPv6 packets over Bluetooth Low Energy. The standard is described in [RFC7668](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7668/), which uses the \n[IPSP characteristics](https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=296307) in Bluetooth >= 4.1.\n\nThe complete IP standard for Bluetooth is defined in the [Bluetooth 4.2 specification](https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=286439).\n\n### RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks)\n\nRPL is a routing protocol used for 6LoWPAN.\n\nThe standard is defined in [RFC 6550](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6550/).\n\n[This video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AP7p0sbBro&t=45s) is a good resource for understanding the details.\n\n### 6LoWPAN border router\n\nBorder routers (sometimes known as edge routers) connect the 6LoWPAN with an IPv6 network.\n\nThe border router connects the network to either the Internet or a private network.\n\n### 6LoWPAN router\n\nA 6LoWPAN router routes the packets to hosts or other routers. The only difference between a router and a border router is that the border router is connected to the Internet.\n\n\n","title":"IPv6 mesh network | Concepts | IoTプロジェクト"}}
