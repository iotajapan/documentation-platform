Open a serial terminal\n\n2. Enter the following to initialize the secure memory with the secret key\n\n    ```bash\n    {\"command\": \"initSecureElement\",\"key\":\"3780e63d4968ade5d822c013fcc323845d1b569fe705b60006feec145a0db1e3\"}\n    ```\n\n    You should see the following:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n    \"code\": 200,\n    \"command\": \"initSecureElement\",\n    \"duration\": 1800\n    }\n    ``` \n\n    Now that the secure memory is initialized with the secret key, you can use it to generate a seed.\n\n3. Enter the following command to generate a seed and store it in the secure memory\n\n    ```bash\n    {\"command\":\"generateRandomSeed\",\"slot\": 0}\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    The CryptoCore can store up to eight seeds in the secure memory.\n    Here, we store the seed in slot 0. If you want to generate more seeds, you can store them in any slot up to and including 6.\n    :::\n\n    You should see the following:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"code\": 200,\n        \"command\":\"generateRandomSeed\",\n        \"duration\":1800\n    }\n    ```\n\n:::success:\nYou have a seed in the secure memory of the CryptoCore.\n:::\n\n## Next steps\n\nThis seed is in secure memory, which is protected and can be read only by using the API.\n\nFor example, you can use the seed to [sign transactions](../references/api-reference.md#signTransaction) or [generate addresses](../references/api-reference.md#generateAddress).","title":"安全にシードを生成する | IOTA プロジェクト | CryptoCore | IoT プロジェクト"}}
