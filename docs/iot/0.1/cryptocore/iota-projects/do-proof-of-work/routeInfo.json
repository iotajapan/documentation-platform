See [this article](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#debinstall) and follow the Ubuntu installation instructions.\n\n## Packages\n\nTo complete this guide, you need to install the following Node.js packages:\n\n--------------------\n### npm\n```bash\nnpm install @iota/core @iota/transaction-converter serialport\n```\n---\n### Yarn\n```bash\nyarn add @iota/core @iota/transaction-converter serialport\n```\n--------------------\n\nYou will also need to install the following Linux package:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install jq\n```\n\n## Step 1. Create a bundle\n\nIn this step, you write a script that creates eight zero-value transactions, chains them into a bundle, and returns the transaction trytes without a proof of work.\n\n1. Create a file called `create-bundle.js`\n\n    ```bash\n    cd ~/cryptocore-scripts/node-scripts\n    sudo nano create-bundle.js\n    ```\n\n2. Use the first argument that is passed to the script to connect to a node on either the Devnet or the Mainnet\n\n    ```js\n    \n    // This argument should be a minimum weight magnitude (14 or 9)\n    const network = process.argv[2];\n\n    // Define a node for each IOTA network\n    const nodes = {\n            devnet: 'https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443',\n            mainnet: `https://nodes.iota.org:443`\n    }\n\n    // Connect to the correct IOTA network, depending on the user's\n    // selection in the CryptoCore script\n    if (network === '14') {\n            iota = Iota.composeAPI({\n            provider: nodes.mainnet\n            });\n    } else {\n            iota = Iota.composeAPI({\n            provider: nodes.devnet\n            });\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. Create a `transfer` object for each zero-value transaction that you want to add to the bundle\n\n    ```js\n    // Define an address to send all transaction to\n    const address = \"CRYPTOCORE99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999\"\n\n    // Create one transfer object for each transaction that you want to send\n    var transfers = [{\n        'address': address,\n        // These transactions do not send IOTA tokens\n        'value': 0,\n        // The `asciiToTrytes()` method supports only basic ASCII characters. As a result, diacritical marks such as accents and umlauts aren't supported and result in an `INVALID_ASCII_CHARS` error.\n        'message': Converter.asciiToTrytes('Hello, this is my first message on a CryptoCore'),\n        'tag': 'CRYPTOCORE'\n    },\n        \n    {\n        'address': address, \n        'value': 0,\n        'message': Converter.asciiToTrytes('Hello, this is my second message on a CryptoCore'),\n        'tag': 'CRYPTOCORE'\n    },\n\n    {\n        'address': address, \n        'value': 0,\n        'message': Converter.asciiToTrytes('Hello, this is my third message on a CryptoCore'),\n        'tag': 'CRYPTOCORE'\n    },\n\n    {\n        'address': address, \n        'value': 0,\n        'message': Converter.asciiToTrytes('Hello, this is my fourth message on a CryptoCore'),\n        'tag': 'CRYPTOCORE'\n    },\n\n    {\n        'address': address, \n        'value': 0,\n        'message': Converter.asciiToTrytes('Hello, this is my fifth message on a CryptoCore'),\n        'tag': 'CRYPTOCORE'\n    },\n\n    {\n        'address': address, \n        'value': 0,\n        'message': Converter.asciiToTrytes('Hello, this is my sixth message on a CryptoCore'),\n        'tag': 'CRYPTOCORE'\n    },\n\n    {\n        'address': address, \n        'value': 0,\n        'message': Converter.asciiToTrytes('Hello, this is my seventh message on a CryptoCore'),\n        'tag': 'CRYPTOCORE'\n    },\n\n    {\n        'address': address, \n        'value': 0,\n        'message': Converter.asciiToTrytes('Hello, this is my eighth message on a CryptoCore'),\n        'tag': 'CRYPTOCORE'\n    }];\n    ```\n    \n4. Use the [`prepareTransfers()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/blob/next/api_reference.md#module_core.prepareTransfers) method to create transactions from the `transfer` objects and chain them into a bundle\n\n    ```js\n    // The library expects a seed, but it is not used because these are zero-value transactions and the bundle does not need to be signed\n    const seed = \"999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999\"\n\n    // Chain the transactions into a bundle\n    iota.prepareTransfers(seed, transfers)\n        .then(function(trytes){\n        console.log(JSON.stringify(trytes));\n        })\n        .catch(error => {\n            console.log(error)\n    });\n    ```\n    ```\n\n## Step 2. Do proof of work on the CryptoCore\n\nIn this step, you use the CryptoCore API to do proof of work for the eight transactions that were created by the `create-bundle.js` script.\n\n1. Create a new file called `do_pow.sh`\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo nano do_pow.sh\n    ```\n\n2. Ask whether the user wants to create a transaction for the Devnet or the Mainnet, and store the answer in the `MWM` variable\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n\n    read -p \"Are you sending this transaction to the Devnet or the Mainnet? \" MWM\n    ```\n\n3. Use a regular expression to check if the user's answer begins with an 'm' and set the [minimum weight magnitude](/docs/getting-started/0.1/network/minimum-weight-magnitude) (MWM) according to the outcome\n\n    ```bash\n    if [[ $MWM =~ ^[mM] ]]\n    then\n            echo \"Setting minimum weight magnitude to 14 for the Mainnet.\"\n            MWM=14\n    else\n            echo \"Setting minimum weight magnitude to 9 for the Devnet.\"\n            MWM=9\n    fi\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    The MWM is essential for the CryptoCore to output a valid proof of work.\n    :::\n\n4. Create a bundle of zero-value transactions by executing the `create-bundle.js` script and save the output to a `trytes` variable\n\n    ```bash\n    echo \"Creating bundle\"\n\n    trytes=$(node ../node-scripts/create-bundle.js $MWM)\n    ```\n\n5. Get two tip transaction hashes from the Tangle by executing the `get-branch-and-trunk.js` script\n\n    ```bash\n    echo \"Getting tip transactions\"\n\n    trunk_and_branch=$(node ../node-scripts/get-branch-and-trunk.js $MWM)\n\n    trunk=$(echo \"$trunk_and_branch\" | jq '.trunkTransaction')\n    branch=$(echo \"$trunk_and_branch\" | jq '.branchTransaction')\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    The `get-branch-and-trunk.js` file uses the [`getTransactionsToApprove()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/next/packages/core#module_core.getTransactionsToApprove) method to get two tip transaction from the Tangle.\n\n    You can find the code for this file on [GitHub](https://github.com/iota-community/cryptocore-scripts/blob/master/node-scripts/get-branch-and-trunk.js).\n    :::\n\n6. Create an `attachToTangle` API request, send it to the CryptoCore through a serial terminal, and save the result to a file\n\n    ```bash\n    # Get the current Unix epoch in milliseconds for the `attachmentTimestamp` field\n    timestamp=$(date +%s%3N)\n\n    # Make sure a directory exists in which to save the transaction trytes\n    dir=\"$( dirname $( readlink -f $0 ) )\"\n    saved_transaction_directory=\"$dir/../my-transactions\"\n\n    if [ ! -d $saved_transaction_directory ]; then\n        mkdir $saved_transaction_directory\n    fi\n\n    echo \"Doing proof of work on CryptoCore\"\n\n    template='{\"command\":\"attachToTangle\",\"trunkTransaction\": %s,\"branchTransaction\":%s,\"minWeightMagnitude\":%d,\"timestamp\":%s,\"trytes\":%s}'\n\n    json_string=$(printf \"$template\" $trunk $branch $MWM $timestamp $trytes)\n\n    node ../node-scripts/serial.js \"$json_string\" > $saved_transaction_directory/attached_trytes.txt\n    ```\n\n    :::info:\n    The `serial.js` file uses the [SerialPort package](https://serialport.io/docs/guide-installation) to open a serial connection to the CryptoCore.\n\n    You can find the code for this file on [GitHub](https://github.com/iota-community/cryptocore-scripts/blob/master/node-scripts/serial.js).\n    :::\n\n7. Send the transaction trytes, which now include a proof of work, to the connected IOTA node by executing the `send-bundle.js` script\n\n    ```bash\n    attached_trytes=$(node ../node-scripts/send-bundle.js $MWM)\n\n    echo \"$attached_trytes\"\n    ```\n\n## Step 3. Send a bundle\n\nIn this step, you write a script that attaches a bundle of transactions to the Tangle.\n\n1. Create a file called `send-bundle.js`\n\n    ```bash\n    cd ~/cryptocore-scripts/node-scripts\n    sudo nano send-bundle.js\n    ```\n\n2. Use the first argument that was passed to the script to connect to a node on either the Devnet or the Mainnet\n\n    ```js\n    // This argument should be a minimum weight magnitude (14 or 9)\n    const network = process.argv[2];\n\n    // Define a node for each IOTA network\n    const nodes = {\n            devnet: 'https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443',\n            mainnet: `https://nodes.iota.org:443`\n    }\n\n    // Connect to the correct IOTA network, depending on the user's\n    // selection in the CryptoCore script\n    if (network === '14') {\n            iota = Iota.composeAPI({\n            provider: nodes.mainnet\n            });\n    } else {\n            iota = Iota.composeAPI({\n            provider: nodes.devnet\n            });\n    }\n\n5. Read the transaction trytes from the file\n\n    ```js\n    // This argument should be the path to which you can save the attached transaction trytes\n    const savedTransactionDirectory = process.argv[3];\n\n    // Read transaction trytes from the file\n    let trytes = fs.readFileSync(`${savedTransactionDirectory}/attached_trytes.txt`).toString();\n\n    if (!trytes) {\n            console.log(\"No trytes found. Make sure that proof of work was done and check the following file :\");\n            console.log(`${savedTransactionDirectory}/attached_trytes.txt`);\n    }\n\n    // Parse the JSON into an array\n    trytes = JSON.parse(trytes);\n    ```\n6. Use the [`storeAndBroadcast()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/next/packages/core#corestoreandbroadcasttrytes-callback) method to send the transactions to the connected node, then print the attached tail transaction hash to the console\n\n    ```js\n    // Send the transaction trytes to the connected IOTA node\n    iota.storeAndBroadcast(trytes)\n    .then(trytes => {\n        console.log(\"Successfully attached transactions to the Tangle\");\n        // Print the transaction details\n        console.log(\"Tail transaction hash: \");\n        console.log(JSON.stringify(trytes.map(t => Transaction.asTransactionObject(t))[trytes.length-1].hash))\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n        console.log(error);\n    });\n    ```\n\n:::success:\nYou have just written a command-line interface (CLI) program that uses the CryptoCore API to do proof of work for eight transactions, and attaches them to the Tangle.\n:::\n\n## Run the code\n\nTo get started, you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your device.\n\nIf you don't have a JavaScript development environment, or if this is your first time using the JavaScript client library, complete our [getting started guide](/docs/client-libraries/0.1/getting-started/js-quickstart).\n\nIn the command-line, do the following:\n\n1. Clone the repository and change into the `cryptocore-scripts/node-scripts` directory\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/iota-community/cryptocore-scripts\n    cd cryptocore-scripts/node-scripts\n    ```\n\n2. Install the packages\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo npm i\n    ```\n\n    You should see something like the following:\n\n    ```\n    npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.\n    added 128 packages from 68 contributors and audited 338 packages in 34.171s\n\n    2 packages are looking for funding\n    run `npm fund` for details\n\n    found 0 vulnerabilities\n    ```\n\n3. Run the `do_pow.sh` script and respond to the prompts\n\n    ```bash\n    cd ~/cryptocore-scripts/bash-scripts\n    sudo ./do_pow.sh\n    ```\n\n4. Follow the prompts\n\nYou should see something like the following:\n\n```bash\nWelcome to the spam bundle creator\nAre you sending transactions to the Devnet or the Mainnet? m\nSetting minimum weight magnitude to 14 for the Mainnet.\nCreating bundle\nGetting tip transactions\nDoing proof of work on CryptoCore\nSuccessfully attached transactions to the Tangle\nTail transaction hash:\n\"XDAHIDSSUXIPWPUSVBUWPMYIXWAWPTKLUAHUCVGQRHH9MYGUGVVNVDPRMKULLWTPYQRKSWNTXUQMA9999\"\n```\n\nTo see your bundle on the Tangle, copy the tail transaction hash and paste it into a [Tangle explorer](https://utils.iota.org/).\n\nIf the Tangle explorer doesn't display your transaction after 5 minutes, the node may not have sent your transaction to its neighbors.\n\nTo resend your transaction, you can pass the transaction trytes in the `my-transactions/attached_trytes.txt` file to the [`storeAndBroadcast()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/next/packages/core#corestoreandbroadcasttrytes-callback) method in the JavaScript client library.\n\n## Next steps\n\n[Generate a random seed](../iota-projects/generate-a-seed.md) on the CryptoCore and store it in the secure memory.","title":"プルーフオブワークを実行する | IOTA プロジェクト | CryptoCore | IoT プロジェクト"}}
