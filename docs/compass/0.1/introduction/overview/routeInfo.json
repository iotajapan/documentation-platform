You can use Compass to run your own IOTA network for testing and development purposes.**\n\nIOTA is a distributed network of nodes that validate transactions and store them. Before nodes can update the balance of an address, they must reach a consensus on any transactions that lead to the updated balance. When nodes reach a consensus, on transactions, those transactions are confirmed.\n\nOn the IOTA Mainnet, the [Coordinator](/docs/the-tangle/0.1/concepts/the-coordinator) creates, signs, and sends bundles that contain milestones. The nodes on this network use these milestone to reach a consensus. Any transaction that's referenced and approved by a milestone is confirmed.\n\nCompass is an open-source implementation of the Coordinator. You can use Compass to allow the nodes in your own IOTA network to reach a consensus on Compass' milestones instead of the Coordinator's ones.\n\nTo allow your nodes to reach a consensus, you must configure your nodes to recognize Compass milestones. Then, you can configure Compass to send milestones to one of your nodes at regular intervals.\n\n:::info:\n[Create your own IOTA network](../how-to-guides/create-an-iota-network.md).\n:::\n\n## Repository\n\nGo to the Compass source code on [Github](https://github.com/iotaledger/compass)\n\n## Further reading \n\n- [IOTA papers discussing the Tangle and other protocol features](https://www.iota.org/research/academic-papers)\n- [A series of posts discussing the removal of the Coordinator](https://blog.iota.org/coordinator-part-1-the-path-to-coordicide-ee4148a8db08)\n","title":"Overview | Introduction | Compass"}}
